<h2>MORE ABOUT THE “INDUSTRY BAND.”</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was with a sad look upon her wrinkled
old face and a heavy weight tugging at
her heart, that Grandma Frink unlocked
the door of her little cottage one September
morning. There came over her the feeling
that perhaps she would not go in and out
that door many more times. She had heard bad
news that morning; the basket of clothes which
she brought from the Kingsleys was the last she
would have to “do up” for them. They had
been her best customers, and now they were all
going to Europe for two years at least. Two
other families for whom she had worked had
already gone away, and with the winter approaching
what was the poor lone woman to do! The
little cottage was her own; it had been free
from debt until two years before the expenses
of her husband’s long illness had used up their
little savings; and when at length he died, the
poor woman was obliged to mortgage her home
to pay the doctor’s bill and funeral expenses.
Thus far she had been able to keep up the interest,
but now work had grown scarce, and pay-day
was near at hand, but she had not a cent
with which to meet it! Many tears fell into the
suds that day, and more fell upon the dainty
ruffles which she fluted for the last time. It
was while she was putting the finishing touches
to Minnie Kingsley’s ruffled and tucked and lace-trimmed
dress, that Satie Howe came in, and
seeing the tears soon had the whole sad story.
And that was the way the “Industry Band” got
hold of Grandma Frink’s trouble. With the
same energy with which they set about buying
a cow for Mrs. Peters, two years before, they
now set about lifting another burden from off
shoulders too weak to bear it.</div>

<p>“You see,” said Satie, telling it to the band,
“her heart was just <i>full</i> yesterday, and she told
it all out to me. I do not believe anyone would
have got it out of her at any other time. It
seems that she has a small annuity, which, with
the work she can do, makes her very comfortable;
but this interest money comes hard, especially
as she has less work this summer than
usual. Now I thought that if we could pay the
interest, perhaps she would get on, and another
year she may get more work.”</p>

<p>“That would be a good thing to do,” said Lou
Brandt, “but it would be better if we could pay
the mortgage, then there would be no interest.”</p>

<p>“Pay the mortgage!” exclaimed two or three
at once in tones which indicated that they
thought Lou had taken leave of her wits.</p>

<p>“Why not? It is only seventy-five dollars,
and it is a great pity if twenty-five boys and
girls cannot raise that amount! Satie told me
about the trouble, last night, and when father
came home I asked him about it and he said that
the interest would not help matters, for the mortgage
will be due this fall, and Major Grimes
means to foreclose if it is not paid up. Granny
has lived in that little house forty years; if she
were turned out now, she would not know what
to do. She has not a relative in the world.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do it! We can get the money, somehow,
I know!” said one of the boys. “I suppose
Major Grimes thinks he will get the cottage into
his own hands, for little or nothing, but we will
show him the <i>Industry Band</i> mean business!”</p>

<p>“If we cannot raise the money in two months
I am sure we can find somebody who will advance
it and hold the mortgage as security until
we can pay it,” said Lou.</p>

<p>“O Lou! what a business head you have on
your shoulders!” said John Baker.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s proceed directly to business, and
see if there are not others with equally good
heads. We will meet Thursday afternoon at
four o’clock and bring in our pledges. We can
each think it over between now and then and
decide how much we can give right out of our
own pocket money.”</p>

<p>To this plan all agreed; then they separated.</p>

<p>Annie Williams was the youngest member of
the band. She had not much money of her own,
and this plan which Lou proposed, presented
serious difficulties to the child. Just a few days
before, she had spent her last penny, and she did
not know how she was to get any money to give
toward this fund. That night she added to her
evening prayer this petition: “Dear Jesus, if
thou would’st have me do something to help
poor Mrs. Frink out of her trouble, wilt thou
show me the way? If I can earn any money,
please tell me where the work is for me to do.”
Then she went to bed, content to leave it all
with Jesus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>When they met according to appointment on
Thursday afternoon, Lou who was treasurer of
the band was ready with book and pencil to put
down the names and pledges. Tom Mason was
there, money in hand. “I can give three dollars;
I sold some ducks yesterday, and father gave me
a dollar for doing the meanest job on the farm.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked one of the boys.</p>

<p>“As if you didn’t know that there is nothing
a boy hates like picking up stones all day!”</p>

<p>Another could give a dollar and fifty cents,
another, two dollars; and the girls, when were
they ever behind in giving? Laura Kline had
concluded to wear her last year’s hat, and give
what a new one would cost. Nell Blake had
agreed to wash the breakfast dishes for a month,
so that her mother could do more of the family
sewing, and the money saved was to be hers,
to give to the fund. Lou Brandt said, “Well,
I think I have taken the hardest job of you all;
I have agreed not to use a single slang phrase
for a whole year, and I am to have five dollars
a month! I will give the money for the first two
months towards paying off the mortgage, and if
we do not raise it all in that time perhaps I will
give another month’s pay.”</p>

<p>“But suppose you fail?” said Satie Howe.
“I think you will have to give security.”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” said Lou laughingly, and as she
spoke she took off her heavy gold bracelets
which had been her last birthday present, and
laid them beside Tom’s three dollars. They all
laughed and Satie said, “Well, Lou, I guess we
can trust you to redeem those!”</p>

<p>When Annie Williams’ name was called she
said, “I do not know how much I can give. I
am sure to have something, but I have not found
out yet how much He wants me to give.”</p>

<p>“Who wants you to give?” asked Lou.</p>

<p>“Why, Jesus; I asked him, but he has not
told me yet.” The girls were hushed and awed;
how many of them had thought to ask Jesus
about it! Lou laid down her pencil and her
voice trembled with emotion as she said,</p>

<p>“Girls, boys, we have made a mistake! We
have begun wrong! Let us pray about this
too!” Dropping upon her knees, while the
others followed her example, Lou’s voice led
them in a prayer for God’s direction in this
matter which they had been considering, and
for his blessing upon all their efforts as well.</p>

<p>“That was what they call ‘a new departure,’”
said Tom Mason. Another boy remarked,</p>

<p>“It is queer that with so many of us belonging
to the church, we should have band meetings
without an opening and closing prayer!
but that little mouse stirred us up, so that I
reckon we shall do better after this.”</p>

<p>Annie Williams came to the next meeting with
a bright face; when her name was called she
walked over to the treasurer and laid down a bit
of paper which read after the usual form of bank
checks: “Pay to the order of Annie Williams five
dollars;” and was signed “John Williams.”</p>

<p>“Papa showed me how to write on the back—‘endorse
it,’ he called it,” and turning the paper
over she brought to view, “Pay to the order of
Louise Brandt. Annie Williams.” And she
added, “Papa said if you took that to any bank
they would give you the money, only you would
have to put your name under mine.”</p>

<p>“What business women we are getting to be!”
said Tom Mason.</p>

<p>“Do you want to hear about it?” asked Annie
when the laugh at Tom’s remark subsided.</p>

<p>“Of course we do!” said Lou.</p>

<p>“You know I staid a long time out at uncle
John’s last spring; one day uncle brought in a
little lamb and said ‘See here, Annie, if you will
save this lamb’s life you may have it. The poor
thing’s mother will not own it, and unless you
feed it it will die.’ Aunt Mary showed me how
to feed it, and it grew; and before I came away
it was a big lamb. I used to feed it with a
spoon out of a bowl, and I grew real fond of it.
The other day uncle John wrote to me that he
was going to sell all his flock, and that he was
sorry, but he thought he must sell my lamb too.
He is going to Florida next winter, and there
would be no one at the farm who could take care
of it, so he sent me five dollars! You can’t think
how glad I was; I knew right away that Jesus
had answered my prayer.”</p>

<p>I cannot describe all the ways by which the
money came in, but you will not be surprised
when I tell you that when the money on the
mortgage came due, the “Industry Band” were
ready to become the purchasers, and that Grandma
Frink was made the happiest woman in the
village of Danvers.</p>

<h2>SIX O’CLOCK IN THE EVENING.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh
in the name of the lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw
all men unto me.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God,
believe also in me.</span></p></blockquote>

<p class='drop-cap'>“HERE is another chance to fit my story to
two of your verses,” said Grandma, and
all the young Burtons looked glad.</p>

<p>“It was the summer I was twelve,” said
Grandma, “and I spent it at Grandfather Holland’s.
He was a minister, you know. We used
to have very pleasant Sunday evenings, talking
over the sermon, and reciting the catechism;
there wasn’t any Sunday-school in those days;
not in our part of the country.</p>

<p>“One night we had the story of Jesus washing
the disciples’ feet. Cousin Mercy said she
didn’t see how he <i>could</i> do it; to think of his
washing Judas’ feet, too! She thought it was
wonderful!</p>

<p>“I said it was wonderful, but I could see how
he could do it, and in a sense like to do it; that
it showed how truly noble he was, and that I
should like a chance to treat an enemy kindly,
because I thought it would be a splendid thing
to do. But I added, rather mournfully, that I
did not suppose I should ever have an enemy.
Grandfather did not make much reply; he only
smiled on me, a curious sort of smile, and repeated
this third verse of yours: ‘If ye know
these things, happy are ye if ye do them.’</p>

<p>“Then what did cousin Stephen do, but repeat,
with his eyes fixed on me, this next verse: ‘Let
him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he
fall.’</p>

<p>“I felt my cheeks grow red. I wished I could
have a chance to show Steenie how truly noble
I was; for I saw he didn’t believe it.</p>

<p>“The very next week something happened
which made me think of those two verses again.</p>

<p>“I went to the little village school, while I
was at grandfather’s; and Priscilla Howe went
too. Priscilla was a bound girl whom my grandfather
was bringing up.”</p>

<p>“Bound!” exclaimed little Sarah, in startled
tone; Grandma had to stop and explain to her
what that meant. Then she continued her
story.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like Priscilla very well; I hardly
knew why; she was a still, cold, little thing, a
trifle sullen, perhaps; at least I thought so, and
I didn’t have much to do with her. On Wednesday
afternoons we had an exercise in school
which I always liked.</p>

<p>“The afternoon before, the teacher would
read to us a certain article, generally a description
of something; a great meeting, maybe, or a
fire, or a storm; we were to take what notes we
pleased, while the reading was going on. Then
the next day we were to bring in our written
account of that same thing; using as few words,
and as short ones, as we could, to get in all the
facts; and the scholar who brought in the best
paper, with the fewest mistakes in spelling, and
punctuation, wore home the medal for composition.
Now I had a good memory, and it seemed
to come natural to me to write out things; so I
liked this exercise. But poor Priscilla hated it;
she could not remember half a dozen things in
the article; and couldn’t express them. Tuesday
evening grandfather let me sit in his study
while I wrote out my exercise. The story was
a very nice one, and I felt sure of getting the
medal.</p>

<p>“The next morning, when I went to get ready
for school, my exercise was nowhere to be found;
I made a great noise about it, and every one in
the house helped me look; but the exercise was
gone. I tried to get time to write another, but
I couldn’t, and I missed the medal of course;
and cried bitterly. The next day I found the
exercise; where, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked all the Burtons at once, in
tones of eager interest and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Down in the bottom of Priscilla’s mending
basket, all torn into little tiny bits, less than
half an inch square!”</p>

<p>You should have heard the murmur of indignation
which ran through the audience then!</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how I felt,” said Grandma.
“I went down to the sitting-room where the
family were gathered, but I was too angry to
trust my voice to tell the story. They were all
busy, and I crept into a corner with my dark little
face, and kept still. My cousin Mercy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
at the piano. I ought to tell you about that piano,
children,” said Grandma, breaking from her
story. “It was the only one in that part of the
world; pianos were scarcer in those days than
they are now; and Mercy’s was a great curiosity;
it had been sent to her by a rich uncle, who
went away off to foreign parts and made a fortune.</p>

<p>“It would look very queer and old-fashioned
to you, but it was a great wonder and delight to
me.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus014.jpg" width="600" height="489" alt="girl playing while grandfather and sister listens" />
<div class="caption">MERCY AT THE PIANO.</div>
</div>

<p>“Mercy called me to come and sing a hymn,
but dear me! I couldn’t have sung if they had
promised me a piano of my own for doing it.
Just then, my aunt Martha, who was grandfather’s
housekeeper, said, as she looked from the
window, ‘There comes Priscilla with three
lighted candles in her hands; how often I have
told that child not to carry three candles at
once! Run, Ruthie dear, and open the door for
her; she will burn herself, or set the house on
fire.’</p>

<p>“But ‘Ruthie’ did not run. I sat as still as
a stone. ‘Ruth!’ said my grandfather, astonished,
while my cousin Stephen laid aside his
book, and went toward the door: ‘I can’t open
doors for her!’ I burst forth; ‘not if she burns
herself up! She tore my exercise into little bits,
and I hate her!’</p>

<p>“Children, don’t you feel ashamed of your
Grandma? Was ever such a wicked and at the
same time silly little burst of rage? It ended
with a perfect flood of tears. Grandfather was
a wise man, and felt that this was no time for
explanations, but as I hurried from the room, I
heard cousin Stephen’s mocking voice saying:
‘Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed
lest he fall.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“It dried my tears in a minute, that verse
did. All the Sunday evening talk, and my
boastful words, came back to me, and I just
<i>hated</i> myself, as I sat in my own little room in
the dark, and went over the whole thing. How
angry I had been with Priscilla; and yet, only
three days before, I had wanted an enemy, that
I might show everybody how noble I was!
After awhile I cried again; but I don’t think
there was any anger in those tears. I did feel
so <i>ashamed</i>, and so disappointed in myself. To
think that the Lord Jesus could wash the feet
of Judas, and I could not open a door for a little
girl who had torn my paper! I did want to
be a good girl, and follow my Saviour’s example;
and it seemed so dreadful to have failed!</p>

<p>“It was a very meek and miserable little girl
who stole around to grandfather’s side that
evening, in answer to his gentle call. In a low
voice, and with a few tears dropping quietly, I
told him the whole sad story; and I can seem
to hear his voice yet, as he said, sorrowfully,
after a few minutes: ‘Yes poor little girl; you
are learning how much easier it is to resolve,
than to <i>do</i>. ”If ye know these things, happy are
ye if ye do them,“ the Saviour said.’</p>

<p>“Mercy was at the piano again, touching the
keys softly; she began to sing in a low voice:</p>

<p class='poem'>
Arise, my soul, arise;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shake off thy guilty fears;</span><br />
The bleeding sacrifice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In my behalf appears;</span><br />
Before the throne my surety stands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My name is graven on his hands—</span><br />
</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said my grandfather, and he placed his
dear old hand on my head, ‘little Ruth must
try again; He knows all about it, and will forgive
her; it was because He knew she couldn’t
be gentle, and forgiving, and loving, all alone,
that He came down here, and lived, and died.’</p>

<p>“I’ve never forgotten it, children; but I can
tell you one thing; it was a long time before I
did any more boasting. It was a long time before
cousin Stephen could see me, without beginning,
‘Let him that thinketh,’ and laughing a little.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the audience for a few
minutes after Grandma’s voice ceased; then
Ralph made his speech: “Well, I think Priscilla
was a bad, wicked girl; and ought to have
been punished.”</p>

<h2>A FRIEND IN NEED.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="127" height="135" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">“WHO are those oddly dressed
children?” asked Miss Vinton.
She was reclining in her invalid’s
chair, which was drawn up before
the window looking out upon the
street. “I have seen them pass
several times lately and I think they must be
new-comers in the neighborhood.”</div>

<p>“They are,” replied Emma Copeland, her
companion; “they belong to a German family
that have moved into the little house back of
Mr. Swift’s.”</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about them?”</p>

<p>Emma smiled; she had been waiting for this
question. She knew that sooner or later Miss
Vinton would find them out and would want to
know all about them, not from curiosity, but
from a desire and purpose to aid, if in any way
they needed help that she could give.</p>

<p>“The family consists of the father and mother
and these two children, besides the baby. The
baby is sick, and I think they are quite poor.
The children sell flowers; you remember there
is a garden attached to that house. They go
past every morning with baskets of flowers
which they take to town. The father means to
raise fruit and vegetables, but as this is the beginning,
they are poorly prepared for sickness.”</p>

<p>“I see!” replied Miss Vinton thoughtfully.
Presently she said, “Emma, I think you will
have to go out upon an errand for me.”</p>

<p>“Down to the Rutgers?” asked Emma.</p>

<p>“Yes; your German will enable you to understand
enough to find out their needs. Who is
their physician, do you know?”</p>

<p>“I saw Doctor Prince pass this morning, perhaps
he was going there.”</p>

<p>“There he is coming up the street now!” exclaimed
Miss Vinton; “Emma, ask him to come
in for a moment, if he is not in too much haste.”</p>

<p>He came in smiling, saying without being
questioned, “You want to know about the Rutgers,
I suppose?” he understood Miss Vinton.</p>

<p>“Yes; do they need anything that I can supply?”</p>

<p>“So far as I can judge they would do very
well if it were not for this sickness. If you
can send comforts for the sick child, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
help. I would suggest the loan of a cot-bed, a
soft pillow, and something in the way of a child’s
wrapper, besides nourishing, easily digested food.
Milk, beef extract—you know what to send?”</p>

<p>“Do you think the child will get well?”</p>

<p>“There is no reason why, with proper care
and plenty of nourishing food, the child should
not recover. If the family could be relieved
so that the mother could give her whole time
to the care of the child all would be well, so far
as I can see.”</p>

<p>“I understand. I will see what I can do.”</p>

<p>Then the doctor bowed himself out, and as he
went down street he said within himself, “I
declare! to look at that girl and know what her
sufferings are, one would feel that if any one
could be excused for letting other people take
care of themselves she would be the one. Yet
she does more to help the poor, and smooth the
beds of the sick and suffering than any other five
women in this whole town! The Rutgers will
find their path brightening, I am thinking!”</p>

<p>This was a true prophecy. Emma Copeland
knew just how to carry out the wishes of her
friend, and before noon the sick child lay in a
clean white wrapper upon a fresh cot-bed. A
little stand stood near with a white napkin
spread upon it and a tray with a cup of beef
tea, a glass of milk, a tiny saucer of nourishing
jelly, a silver spoon on the tray, another beside
the glass of medicine, and the mother had been
made to understand that she was to give her
whole time to the care of her sick child. A
loaf of bread, and a piece of meat, and other
things from the Vinton larder emphasized this
injunction. The children, Carl and Gretchen,
moved softly about; Conrad himself peeped in
now and then to look upon the little one lying
now so comfortably in the white bed, going
back to his work with a lighter heart, saying in
his native tongue, “God bless the kind lady!”
One morning a visitor said to May Vinton:</p>

<p>“I am afraid you trouble yourself too much
about other people. I hear you have taken up a
poor German family. Why do you not let the
authorities take care of the town’s poor?”</p>

<p>“Well, I am egotistical enough to think that
I can do some things better than the authorities!
They do not give sympathy, nor advice;
and this is what some people need most of all.
Then again Christ was not speaking of the
public authorities when he said, ‘Inasmuch as
ye have done it unto one of the least of these
ye have done it unto me.’ Besides a little help
to these people, such as we would give to any
friend in the time of sickness, does not degrade
them in their own eyes nor in the estimation of
their neighbors, as help from a public charity
might. They only needed tiding over a deep
place, now they will do well enough.”</p>

<p>And so they did. A few weeks later the
cot-bed was again in its place in Mrs. Vinton’s
store-room. The sick child was every day putting
on flesh and strength. The mother could
now care for her household, and the whole
family rejoiced, with hearts full of love and
gratitude to their new friend. Carl and Gretchen
came now and then to visit Miss Vinton, always
bringing some little token. The children were
shy little things, but it was a great treat to them
to go into that handsome room and talk with
its fair, though suffering occupant. In their gratitude
they treasured every word she uttered,
and carried away many useful lessons.</p>

<p>One day, long afterward, when Gretchen had
grown to be a young lady and Carl was studying
in the High School, some one remarked,
“How that family have risen in the world! It
is only a few years since they came here, poor
and friendless, now they have a home and circle
of friends. There’s the Ketlers who came
over at the same time. They have not prospered
nearly so well; the children have grown
up in comparative ignorance. I do not understand
what has made the difference.”</p>

<p>“I can explain it,” said another, “there’s an
influence going out from that front corner room
of the Vinton homestead which has power to
revolutionize hearts and lives and to build up
families; when the Rutgers first came they fell
under that influence, and it is this which has
made the difference. I suppose a small sum
would cover all the money Miss Vinton expended
for the family, but there is a great deal
in doing things at the right time and in giving
your money and sympathy when most needed.”</p>

<p>“But there must be something back of what
we see,” said the first speaker.</p>

<p>“Yes; a consecrated life lies behind the
work.”</p>

<h2>REACHING OUT.<br />

<small>(<i>A further Account of Nettie Decker and her Friends.</i>)</small></h2>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">By Pansy.</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a-1.jpg" width="72" height="114" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">AS a matter of fact there wasn’t a cake
left. Neither doughnut nor gingersnap;
hardly a crumb to tell the successful
tale. Nettie surveyed the
empty shelves the next morning in
astonishment. She had been too busy the
night before to realize how fast things were going.
Naturally the number and variety of
dishes in the Decker household was limited and
the evening to Nettie was a confused murmur
of, “Hand us in some more cups.”</div>

<p>“Can’t you raise a few more teaspoons somewhere?”
“Give us another plate,” or, “More
doughnuts needed;” and Nettie flew hither and
thither, washed cups, rinsed spoons, said, “What
did I do with that towel?” or, “Where in the
world is the bread knife?” or, “Oh! I smell
the coffee! maybe it is boiling over,” and was
conscious of nothing but weariness and relief
when the last cup of coffee was drank, and the
last teaspoon washed.</p>

<p>But with the next morning’s sunshine she
knew the opening was a success. She counted
the gains with eager joy, assuring Jerry that
they could have twice as much gingerbread next
time.</p>

<p>“And you’ll need it,” said Norm. “I had to
tell half a dozen boys that there wasn’t a crumb
left. I felt sorry for ’em, too; they were boarding-house
fellows who never get anything decent
to eat.”</p>

<p>Already Norm had apparently forgotten that
he was one who used frequently to make a similar
complaint.</p>

<p>There was a rarely sweet smile on Nettie’s
face, not born of the chink in the factory bag
which she had made for the money; it grew
from the thought that she need not hide the bag
now, and tremble lest it should be taken to the
saloon to pay for whiskey. What a little time
ago it was that she had feared that! What a
changed world it was!</p>

<p>“But there won’t be such a crowd again,”
she said as they were putting the room in order,
“that was the first night.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said that wise woman Susie with
a significant toss of her head; “last night you
said we mustn’t expect anybody because it <i>was</i>
the first night.”</p>

<p>Then “the firm” had a hearty laugh at Nettie’s
expense and set to work preparing for evening.</p>

<p>I am not going to tell you the story of that
summer and fall. It was beautiful; as any of
the Deckers will tell you with eager eyes and
voluble voice if you call on them, and start the
subject.</p>

<p>The business grew and grew, and exceeded
their most sanguine expectations. Mr. Decker
interested himself in it most heartily, and
brought often an old acquaintance to get a cup
of coffee. “Make it good and strong,” he
would say to Nettie in an earnest whisper.
“He’s thirsty, and I brought him here instead
of going for beer. I wish the room was larger,
and I’d get others to come.”</p>

<p>In time, and indeed in a very short space of
time, this grew to be the crying need of the
firm: “If we only had more room, and more
dishes!” There was a certain long, low building
which had once been used as a boarding-house
for the factory hands, before that institution
grew large and moved into new quarters, and
which was not now in use. At this building
Jerry and Nettie, and for that matter, Norm,
looked with longing eyes. They named it “Our
Rooms,” and hardly ever passed, that they did
not suggest some improvement in it which could
be easily made, and which would make it just
the thing for their business. They knew just
what sort of curtains they would have at the
the windows, just what furnishings in front and
back rooms, just how many lamps would be
needed. “We will have a hanging lamp over
the centre table,” said Jerry. “One of those
new-fashioned things which shine and give a
bright light, almost like gas; and lots of books
and papers for the boys to read.”</p>

<p>“But where would we get the books and
papers?” would Nettie say, with an anxious
business face, as though the room, and the
table, and the hanging lamp, were arranged for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and the last-mentioned articles all that were
needed to complete the list.</p>

<p>“Oh! they would gather, little by little. I
know some people who would donate great
piles of them if we had a place to put them.
For that matter, as it is, father is going to send
us some picture-papers, a great bundle of them;
send them by express, and we must have a table
to put them on.”</p>

<p>So the plans grew, but constantly they looked
at the long, low building and said what a nice
place it would be.</p>

<p>One morning Jerry came across the yard with
a grave face. “What do you think?” he said,
the moment he caught sight of Nettie. “They
have gone and rented our rooms for a horrid
old saloon; whiskey in front, and gambling in
the back part! Isn’t it a shame that they have
got ahead of us in that kind of way?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear me!” said Nettie, drawing out each
word to twice its usual length, and sitting down
on a corner of the woodbox with hands clasped
over the dish towel, and for the moment a look
on her face as though all was lost.</p>

<p>But it was the very same day that Jerry
appeared again, his face beaming. This time it
was hard to make Nettie hear, for Mrs. Decker
was washing, and mingling with the rapid rub-a-dub
of the clothes was the sizzle of ham in
the spider, and the bubble of a kettle which
was bent on boiling over, and making the half-distracted
housekeeper all the trouble it could.
Yet his news was too good to keep; and he
shouted above the din: “I say, Nettie, the man
has backed out! Our rooms are not rented,
after all.”</p>

<p>“Goody!” said Nettie, and she smiled on the
kettle in a way to make it think she did not
care if everything in it boiled over on the floor;
whereupon it calmed down, of course, and behaved
itself.</p>

<p>So the weeks passed, and the enterprise grew
and flourished. I hope you remember Mrs.
Speckle? Very early in the autumn she sent
every one of her chicks out into the world to
toil for themselves and began business. Each
morning a good-sized, yellow-tinted, warm, beautiful
egg lay in the nest waiting for Jerry; and
when he came, Mrs. Speckle cackled the news
to him in the most interested way.</p>

<p>“She couldn’t do better if she were a regularly
constituted member of the firm with a
share in the profits,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>The egg was daily carried to Mrs. Farley’s,
where there was an invalid daughter, who had
a fancy for that warm, plump egg which came
to her each morning, done up daintily in pink
cotton, and laid in a box just large enough for
it. But there came a morning which was a
proud one to Nettie. Jerry had returned from
Mrs. Farley’s with news. “The sick daughter
is going South; she has an auntie who is to
spend the winter in Florida, so they have decided
to send her. They start to-morrow morning.
Mrs. Farley said they would take our
eggs all the same, and she wished Miss Helen
could have them; but somebody else would
have to eat them for her.”</p>

<p>Then Nettie, beaming with pleasure, “Jerry,
I wish you would tell Mrs. Farley that we can’t
spare them any more at present; I would have
told you before, but I didn’t want to take the
egg from Miss Helen; I want to buy them
now, every other morning, for mother and
father; mother thinks there is nothing nicer
than a fresh egg, and I know father will be
pleased.”</p>

<p>What satisfaction was in Nettie’s voice,
what joy in her heart! Oh! they were poor,
very poor, “miserably poor” Lorena Barstow
called them, but they had already reached the
point where Nettie felt justified in planning for
a fresh egg apiece for father and mother, and
knew that it could be paid for. So Mrs. Speckle
began from that day to keep the results of her
industry in the home circle, and grew more
important because of that.</p>

<p>Almost every day now brought surprises. One
of the largest of them was connected with Susie
Decker. That young woman from the very first
had shown a commendable interest in everything
pertaining to the business. She patiently did
errands for it, in all sorts of weather, and was
always ready to dust shelves, arrange cookies
without eating so much as a bite, and even wipe
teaspoons, a task which she used to think beneath
her. “If you can’t trust me with things
that would smash,” she used to say with scornful
gravity, to Nettie, “then you can’t expect
me to be willing to wipe those tough spoons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>But in these days, spoons were taken uncomplainingly.
Susie had a business head, and was
already learning to count pennies and add them
to the five and ten cent pieces; and when Jerry
said approvingly: “One of these days, she will
be our treasurer,” the faintest shadow of a
blush would appear on Susie’s face, but she
always went on counting gravely, with an air
of one who had not heard a word.</p>

<p>On a certain stormy, windy day, one of
November’s worst, it was discovered late in the
afternoon that the molasses jug was empty, and
the boys had been promised some molasses candy
that very evening.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LITTLE HOUSE ORGAN.</div>
</div>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Nettie, looking
perplexed, and standing jug in hand in the middle
of the room. “Jerry won’t be home in
time to get it, and I can’t leave those cakes to
bake themselves; mother, you don’t think you
could see to them a little while till I run to the
grocery, do you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Decker shook her head, but spoke sympathetically:
“I’d do it in a minute, child, or I’d
go for the molasses, but these shirts are very
particular; I never had such fine ones to iron
before, and the irons are just right, and if I
should have to leave the bosoms at the wrong
minute to look at the cakes, why, it would spoil
the bosoms; and on the other hand, if I left
the cakes and saved the bosoms, why, they would
be spoiled.”</p>

<p>This seemed logical reasoning. Susie, perched
on a high chair in front of the table, was counting
a large pile of pennies, putting them in
heaps of twenty-five cents each. She waited
until her fourth heap was complete, then looked
up. “Why don’t you ask me to go?”</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” said Nettie, laughing, “I’d
‘ask’ you in a minute if it didn’t rain so hard;
but it seems a pretty stormy day to send out a
little chicken like you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a chicken, and I’m not in the leastest
bit afraid of rain; I can go as well as not if
you only think so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it will hurt her!” said Mrs.
Decker, glancing doubtfully out at the sullen
sky. “It doesn’t rain so hard as it did, and she
has such a nice thick sack now.”</p>

<p>It was nice, made of heavy waterproof cloth,
with a lovely woolly trimming going all around
it. Susie liked that sack almost better than
anything else in the world. Her mother had
bought it second-hand of a woman whose little
girl had outgrown it; the mother had washed
all day and ironed another day to pay for it, and
felt the liveliest delight in seeing Susie in the
pretty garment.</p>

<p>The rain seemed to be quieting a little, so
presently the young woman was robed in sack
and waterproof bonnet with a cape, and started
on her way.</p>

<p>Half-way to the grocery she met Jerry hastening
home from school with a bag of books
slung across his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Is it so late as that?” asked Susie in dismay.
“Nettie thought you wouldn’t be at
home in a good while; the candy won’t get
done.”</p>

<p>“No, it is as early as this,” he answered laughing;
“we were dismissed an hour earlier than
usual this afternoon. Where are you going?
after molasses? See here, suppose you give me
the jug and you take my books and scud home.
There is a big storm coming on; I think the
wind is going to blow, and I’m afraid it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
twist you all up and pour the molasses over
you. Then you’d be ever so sticky!”</p>

<p>Susie laughed and exchanged not unwillingly
the heavy jug for the books. There had been
quite wind enough since she started, and if
there was to be more, she had no mind to brave
it.</p>

<p>“If you hurry,” called Jerry, “I think you’ll
get home before the next squall comes.” So
she hurried; but Jerry was mistaken. The
squall came with all its force, and poor small
Susie was twisted and whirled and lost her
breath almost, and panted and struggled on, and
was only too thankful that she hadn’t the molasses
jug.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite the Farley home, their side
door suddenly opened and a pleasant voice
called: “Little girl, come in here, and wait
until the shower is over; you will be wet to the
skin.”</p>

<p>It is true Susie did not believe that her waterproof
sack <i>could</i> be wet through, but that
dreadful wind so frightened her, twisting the
trees as it did, that she was glad to obey the
kind voice and rush into shelter.</p>

<p>“Why, it is Nettie’s sister, I do believe!”
said Ermina Farley, helping her off with the
dripping hood.</p>

<p>“You dear little mouse, what sent you out in
such a storm?”</p>

<p>Miss Susie not liking the idea of being a
mouse much more than she did being a chicken,
answered with dignity, and becoming brevity.</p>

<p>“Molasses candy!” said Mrs. Farley, laughing,
yet with an undertone of disapproval in
her voice which keen-minded Susie heard and
felt, “I shouldn’t think that was a necessity of
life on such a day as this.”</p>

<p>“It is if you have promised it to some boys
who don’t ever have anything nice only what
they get at our house; and who save their pennies
that they spend on beer, and cider, and
cigars to get it.”</p>

<p>Wise Susie, indignation in every word, yet
well controlled, and aware before she finished
her sentence that she was deeply interesting her
audience! How they questioned her? What
was this? Who did it? Who thought of it?
When did they begin it? Who came? How
did they get the money to buy their things?
Susie, thoroughly posted, thoroughly in sympathy
with the entire movement, calm, collected,
keen far beyond her years, answered clearly
and well. Plainly she saw that this lady in a
silken gown was interested.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t a revelation!” said Mrs.
Farley at last. “A young men’s Christian
association not only, but an eating-house flourishing
right in our midst and we knowing nothing
about it. Did you know anything of it,
daughter?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said Ermina. “But I knew
that splendid Nettie was trying to do something
for her brother; and that nice boy who used to
bring eggs was helping her; it is just like them
both. I don’t believe there is a nicer girl in
town than Nettie Decker.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Farley seemed unable to give up the
subject. She asked many questions as to how
long the boys stayed, and what they did all the
time.</p>

<p>Susie explained: “Well, they eat, you know;
and Norm doesn’t hurry them; he says they
have to pitch the things down fast where they
board, to keep them from freezing; and our
room is warm, because we keep the kitchen
door open, and the heat goes in; but we don’t
know what we shall do when the weather gets
real cold; and after they have eaten all the
things they can pay for, they look at the pictures.
Jerry’s father sends him picture papers,
and Mr. Sherrill brings some, most every day.
Miss Sherrill is coming Thanksgiving night to
sing for them; and Nettie says if we only had
an organ she would play beautiful music. We
want to give them a treat for Thanksgiving;
we mean to do it without any pay at all if we
can; and father thinks we can, because he is
working nights this week, and getting extra
pay; and Jerry thinks there will be two chickens
ready; and Nettie wishes we could have an
organ for a little while, just for Norm, because
he loves music so, but of course we can’t.”</p>

<p>Long before this sentence was finished,
Ermina and her mother had exchanged glances
which Susie, being intent on her story, did not
see.</p>

<p>She was a wise little woman of business;
what if Mrs. Farley should say: “Well, I will
give you a chicken myself for the Thanksgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
time, and a whole peck of apples!” then indeed,
Susie believed that their joy would be
complete; for Nettie had said, if they could
only afford three chickens she believed that
with a lot of crust she could make chicken pie
enough for them each to have a large piece, hot;
not all the boys, of course, but the seven or
eight who worked in Norm’s shop and boarded
at the dreary boarding-house; they would so
like to give Norm a surprise for his birthday,
and have a treat say at six o’clock for all of
these; for this year Thanksgiving fell on Norm’s
birthday. The storm held up after a little, and
Susie, trudging home, a trifle disgusted with
Mrs. Farley because she said not a word about
the peck of apples or the other chicken, was met
by Jerry coming in search of her. The molasses
was boiling over, he told her, and so was her
mother, with anxiety lest the wind had taken
her, Susie, up in a tree, and had forgotten to
bring her down again. He hurried her home
between the squalls, and Susie quietly resolved
to say not a word about all the things she had
told at the Farley home. What if Nettie should
think she hadn’t been womanly to talk so much
about what they were doing! If there was one
thing that this young woman had a horror of
during these days, it was that Nettie would
think she was not womanly. The desire, nay,
the determination to be so, at all costs had well
nigh cured her of her fits of rage and screaming,
because in one of her calm moments Nettie
had pointed out to her the fact that she never
in her life heard a <i>woman</i> scream like that.
Susie being a logical person, argued the rest of
the matter out for herself, and resolved to
scream and stamp her foot no more.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment of the Decker
family, next morning. Mrs. Farley herself came
to call on them. She wanted some plain ironing
done that afternoon. Yes, Mrs. Decker
would do it and be glad to; it was a leisure
afternoon with her. Mrs. Farley wanted something
more! she wanted to know about the
business in which Nettie and her young friend
next door were engaged; and Susie listened
breathlessly, for fear it would appear that she
had told more than she ought. But Mrs. Farley
kept her own counsel, only questioning Nettie
closely, and at last she made a proposition
that had well nigh been the ruin of the tin of
cookies which Nettie was taking from the oven.
She dropped the tin!</p>

<p>“Did you burn you, child?” asked Mrs.
Decker, rushing forward.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am,” said Nettie, laughing, and trying
not to laugh, and wanting to cry, and being
too amazed to do so. “But I was so surprised
and so almost scared, that they dropped.</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Farley, we have wanted that more
than anything else in the world; ever since
Mr. Sherrill saw how my brother Norman
loved music, and said it might be the saving of
him; Jerry and I have planned and planned,
but we never thought of being able to do it for
a long, long time.”</p>

<p>Yet all this joy was over an old, somewhat
wheezy little house organ which stood in the
second-story unused room of Mrs. Farley’s
house, and which she had threatened to send
to the city auction rooms to get out of the
way.</p>

<p>She offered to lend it to Nettie for her
“Rooms,” and Nettie’s gratitude was so great
that the blood seemed inclined to leave her
face entirely for a minute, then thought better
of it and rolled over it in waves.</p>

<h2>A PACKAGE FOR ROSE.</h2>

<h3>NO. II.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">THEY found the scissors in Mrs. Harrison’s
work basket and then sat down
together on the doorstep to open the
package. When the outside paper was
taken off they saw there were really two
small packages, both wrapped alike in white
paper, but one was square and flat, and the
other round and slender,—indeed one might
almost have guessed it to be, as Rose said, a very
large stick of candy.</div>

<p>“Oh, let me open the round one!” cried Priscilla.</p>

<p>“No, I want to open that myself,” said Rose,
“but I’ll let you open the other.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Priscilla pleasantly, “I
will.”</p>

<p>So saying, she began to tear off the paper,
but stopped at an exclamation from Rose.</p>

<p>“See! see! Priscilla, this is old gold satin!”</p>

<p>Sure enough. The round roll proved to be a
banner, fastened to a slender brass rod, and finished
with a fringe of bright little stars. There
was a spray of blue forget-me-nots painted upon
it, and as Rose held it up in the sunlight, both
girls declared that it was very beautiful indeed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t aunt Alice lovely to send me this,”
cried Rose, after they had examined it to their
full satisfaction. “But I can’t see how it’s an
answer to my letter.”</p>

<p>“Maybe this is the answer,” said Priscilla,
taking up the other package. “See, it’s just
sheets of paper, fastened together, and lots of
writing on them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rose, “it’s a letter. Why, no it
isn’t,” she added. “Oh goody! goody! it’s a
story! aunt Alice does tell splendid stories, but
I never thought of her writing one. Come, let’s
read it.”</p>

<p>The pages of the paper were neatly fastened
together, and every word was so plainly written
that the two girls could easily read them.</p>

<p>Rose began as follows:</p>


<h4>THE PERFUMED MANTLE.</h4>

<p>Long ago, in a small village whose cottages
clustered upon a mountain slope, a great number
of people had come together to celebrate a fair
which was held each year for the benefit of that
district.</p>

<p>Some had come to sell and some to buy, but
many were there for pleasure only. Hucksters
and villagers, peasants, and venders of trinkets,
or of useful articles—all were there in bustling
confusion.</p>

<p>Among the crowd had come a man whom no
one could recollect having seen before, and yet
he spoke to each whom he met, calling him by
name. His manner was dignified, quiet and
gentle, and he said that he came neither to buy
nor sell, but that he had a wonderful cloak
which he would give for the asking. He said,
moreover, that it was the safeguard which all
travellers wore who journeyed to the Pleasant
Land.</p>

<p>Now this kingdom, as the people well knew,
lay just beyond their own boundary, toward
the setting of the sun; and indeed many of
them had wished that they might sometime go
thither, for they had heard wondrous reports
of its beauty and of the happiness of its people.
But they had been deterred from setting out by
their affairs at home, and by certain sayings
that had got abroad concerning the difficulties
of the way. So when the stranger spoke thus,
a large number of the people gathered around,
and began to comment on the cloak, which hung
upon the man’s arm and was of some soft woollen
goods. It gave out too, a scent more delicate
and sweet than the fragrance of any flower that
blooms.</p>

<p>Their criticisms were various. One old peasant
said that while he should like to own the
cloak, he feared its elegance might excite the
contempt of his neighbors, who heretofore had
never seen him clothed in anything but coarse
garments.</p>

<p>A woman at his elbow also had a voice in the
matter.</p>

<p>“The opinion of the neighbors,” said she,
“would have little weight with me. But such
a cloak hanging from the shoulders would greatly
hinder one when at work.”</p>

<p>“Yea, that it would,” answered another, “and
work we must, if we would lay up dowries
for our daughters, or buy a bit of land for our
sons. We have none of us time to journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
towards that Western country,” she added reflectively.</p>

<p>Just then a youth wearing the heavy shoes
and blouse of a workman drew near. After
asking some questions, of the way that led to
the Pleasant Land, he declared his intention of
setting out that very hour, but added that he
should have no need of the mantle, for he was
young and sturdy and used to depending upon
himself.</p>

<p>“Yet take the cloak!” urged the stranger,
“for I have never known any traveller to reach
the kingdom without one.”</p>

<p>The youth, however, shook his head, and,
laughing lightly, waved his hand in farewell to
the people.</p>

<p>He turned his face confidently toward the
West, taking a narrow path that led over the
mountain, and thence into a little valley.</p>

<p>It was a quiet, peaceful way bordered by grass
of a tender green and by flowers whose delicacy
showed that they were the blossoms of spring.</p>

<p>One end of the vale was almost shut in by the
rocky walls of two high mountains, and the
pass between them was barred by a massive
gate. Toward this gate the narrow footpath
tended. The youth still felt fresh and vigorous
and it was not long ere he had reached the portal
where at each hand he now beheld a sentinel.</p>

<p>“Few are the days of the journey,” said the
first.</p>

<p>“And, alas! wearisome and profitless to him
who weareth not the mantle of loving kindness,”
said the second.</p>

<p>Immediately the great gate turned noiselessly
on its hinges, and when it closed again the
youth had entered what proved to be a busy
city, with people of all descriptions hurrying
along the streets. Two things were most noticeable:
there was no one amid all the throng who
did not carry a burden of some kind, and there
was not one who had not something peculiar to
himself which was an annoyance to all whom he
met.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” cried the youth, “I see how it is.
If one wants to get through this crowd in any
comfort he must use a sharp tongue, and elbows
or fists to the best advantage.”</p>

<p>So saying, he set out again upon his way, but
was soon met by a band of merry-makers, who
seemed inclined to take up most of the path.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” said the youth to himself, and,
setting his arms akimbo he attempted to push
his way among them. But it was not without
several hard blows that he escaped and passed
on, so perfectly did the company imitate his
manner and attempt to bar his way.</p>

<p>The next to claim his attention was a woman
carrying a heavy basket—and more especially
as the basket was set around with thorns.</p>

<p>“Let me but escape their sharp points,” cried
the youth, “and I care little how hard they
press her.”</p>

<p>The result of the encounter was some scratches
to both travellers, which might have been saved
if each had sought to spare his neighbor pain.</p>

<p>Thus it went from day to-day, sometimes with
sharp words, occasionally with blows, but oftener
a slight push from one passer to the other, until
at last we must leave the youth to pursue his
hopeless journey, while we return to the village
whence he had set out.</p>

<h2>MOZART.</h2>

<h3>PART I.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="73" height="95" alt="N" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">NOW I seem to see some of you Pansies
skipping this article, because you think
is a biographical sketch of the great
musician Mozart, and possibly you “don’t like
biographical sketches.” Or if you do, those of
you who are members of the “P. S.” have read
all about Mozart in your book—“Great Composers.”
But let me assure you at the beginning
that while this is a biographical sketch, and
as true a one as ever was written, and about a
person named Mozart, who was something of a
musician, possibly you will not pass it by so
scornfully when I tell you this Mozart is a cat!</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/illus045.jpg" width="402" height="500" alt="kitten lloking at a butterfly" />
<div class="caption">MOZART.</div>
</div>

<p>He belonged to a family which is quite small,
I believe, though its members are very large, so
that when he was but two or three months old,
he was as large as many ordinary cats, while his
mother was positively colossal!</p>

<p>The way I came to get Mozart was this: his
mother, brothers and sisters, and he, were owned
by my auntie May, and this same auntie was,
once upon a time, about to move from her home
in New York, to New Jersey. Knowing how
I loved cats, when my
mother was visiting her,
she proposed that one of
the kittens should be taken
home to me. So, on the
morning of my father and
mother’s start, one was procured,
and imprisoned in a
willow basket which was
tied with strong cord. Just
as the good-bys were being
said, when the basket was
reposing in the bottom of
the sleigh, and as the driver
was raising his reins preparatory
to the start, my
uncle called out, “Don’t
step on the kitten!” To
which the driver responded,
“It ain’t here!” and grinned
broadly, as the disappointing
animal jumped to the
ground, and sped across the
snow to the stable. There
was no time to recapture
him, for they were then
almost afraid they would
miss the train, and the
sleigh-bells jingled as the
sleigh ran down the hill to
the depot, the occupants
thereof looking curiously
at the empty basket in the
bottom. “How did he get
out?” was the question; and became the question
for discussion on the train, as all day my
mother and father whizzed along from New York
into Pennsylvania. The basket had been found
to be just as securely tied as it was when the kitten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
had first been placed therein, and the only explanation
that could be given when my parents
reached home was, that the kitten <i>had</i> been in
the basket, and was <i>not!</i> Which explanation
was, as you may not be surprised to hear, exceedingly
unsatisfactory to me, for I dearly
loved, and do dearly love all members of the
feline kingdom. I never see one but I feel that
I must stop and pat its soft fur.</p>

<p>But so far, instead of telling you how I did
get Mozart, I have been telling you how I did
<i>not</i> get him!</p>

<p>It was about a week after my father and
mother had reached home, when, one morning,
as we were seated at the breakfast table, the
door-bell rang, and an expressman appeared,
with a grin on his face that seemed literally to
reach from one ear to the other! “’Ere’s a cat!”
he exclaimed, and forthwith produced a box
a foot or two square, the top of which was
decorated, in good-sized letters, with this injunction:</p>

<p class='center'>“THIS SIDE UP WITH CARE!”</p>

<p>As the official brought it into the hall, the listeners
and lookers-on heard a prolonged “Waa-a-a-a-a-a!”
which seemed to echo and re-echo,
and at last died away into silence.</p>

<p>“It is the kitten that we didn’t bring!” said
my mother, while I ran for a hammer and chisel
with which to open the box. When the operation
was performed, there jumped out a large,
yellow, cat-like kitten, which escaped as far as
possible from us, as we tried to grasp it, repeating
its mournful, yet decisive cry of—“Waa-a-a-a-a-a!”</p>

<p>Strange to say, he did not recognize us as
friends, immediately, but preferred to wait until
he formed a closer acquaintance before he was
victimized by our embraces or pettings, so he
was consigned to the cellar, where he spent
much of his time. When we would try to get
him up, unless we succeeded in finding him
asleep, he would climb a beam, and with great
agility elude our efforts to capture him.</p>

<p>Having heard many stories of cats returning
to their former homes, and having had some
experience in that line ourselves, we were careful
to keep Mozart in the house, lest he should
make his escape and be seen no more. If he did
manage to get out of the kitchen door in a
clandestine manner, a ridiculous procession was
formed of the bareheaded members of our family,
and no peace was given the poor animal, until,
after racing around the yard once or twice, he
surrendered to our clutches. Truly our anxious
efforts to capture the unwilling prisoner must
have been a ludicrous sight to any unsympathizing
spectator.</p>

<p>We let Mozart sleep in the kitchen, and this
gave him the chance he apparently coveted, of
sleeping on the table, which he did so obstinately,
that we were finally compelled to resort to the
expedient of turning the table on its side every
night, so that if he slept on it, it would have to
be in direct resistance to the law of gravitation!</p>

<p>Mozart also showed a great desire to make
the table his dining-room, though this freak
was explained on the arrival of my auntie May,
who said that he had eaten on an old table in
the barn at home. He also probably slept
there. But with us he was obliged to make his
couch on some old pieces of carpeting.</p>

<p>I now remember that I have not yet given a
thorough description of my hero, and as that is
properly one of the first things to do in a sketch
of this kind, I must hasten to it. Mozart was
clothed with a stationary garment of brownish-yellow
fur—I do not know whether the artists
would call it chrome yellow, yellow ochre, Naples
yellow, or what. This garment was at
regular intervals striped with rings of a darker
shade, and these went completely around his
body.</p>

<p>These rings reached their abrupt termination
at the tip of the wearer’s tail. It is quite proper
to insert just here the fact that once upon a
time one of them fell off, and was found, a little
wad of dark yellow fur, on the floor of the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mozart had eyes of a rather uncertain color
(a peculiarity of his family, which you perhaps
have observed), but they were probably
nearer the color of his fur than any other of
which I think. His head was shapely, and his
ears and caudal appendage were graceful.
Thus endeth the description of his personal appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason for naming Mozart as I did, will
be obvious when I state that he had unmistakable
musical talent. As I cannot conscientiously
praise his voice, I will remain silent about it,
simply saying that it was very expressive, and
that is more than can be said of some of the so-called
fine singers of this country. His vocal
organs seemed exceedingly devoid of elasticity,
for their use was always confined to the one
syllable and note—“Waa-a-a-a-a-a!” differing
only in pitch and the length of time it was prolonged.</p>

<p>This difficulty prevented us from always comprehending
Mozart’s language, save by his
accompanying gestures and actions, and by the
surrounding circumstances. But I have said
more about his voice than I intended. As I
said before, he had unmistakable musical talent.
If he had not a musical voice, he had a musical
ear (two of them, indeed!) and would listen
with rapturous delight to any music. If anyone
was playing on my piano, he would come and
sit by the side of it, and either listen intently or
try to find out by his whiskers from whence the
sound proceeded. But if, while he was making
these investigations, the piano would play very
loud for a moment, he would shrink away, much
frightened by the noise. If it was a special
friend of his who was playing, he would sometimes
jump into the person’s lap, getting as near
as possible to the keys. Any rational and unprejudiced
persons giving heed to these statements,
will believe what I said about Mozart’s
ears, I am sure.</p>

<p>Unlike most of his sex, the second John
Chrysostom Wolfgang Theophilus Mozart (for
we had given him the full name of the great
musician, calling him simply Mozart for short)
seemed to take an interest in the art of sewing.
I may record as a proof of this that when my
aunt Julia would be sewing on her machine, my
hero would jump up into the vacancy between
her spinal column and the chair, and there
remain until he was dismissed. If he had
been allowed a longer time to stay there than
<i>was</i> given him, he would, probably, not have
left so soon, but as to that I cannot positively
speak.</p>

<p>Before recording the following incident I will
repeat the aforesaid statement that every word
of this biographical sketch is strictly true, and
unto that fact I will set my signature and seal,
any time you wish. (Possibly that is one particular
in which this differs from most biographical
sketches.)</p>

<p>Mozart’s saucer from which he was in the
habit of eating and drinking, stood out in the
kitchen by the sink. On the day of which I
speak, he came in and told in plaintive accents
that something was the matter. As I have remarked
heretofore, he always left us in uncertainty
as to <i>what</i>, for a time, at least. When
questioned, however, he earnestly smelled of his
empty saucer, and then, jumping up on the sink,
put his paw on the cold water faucet, and then,
descending, repeated his summons for aid. The
saucer was speedily filled with water, and he
drank long and eagerly.</p>

<p>This same incident was repeated in every
particular, at another time, with the faucet in
the bath-room upstairs.</p>

<p>On one occasion Mr. Mozart did a most disgraceful
thing—one that was enough to bring
disrepute on any family—namely, he ran away.
There were several cats living around our barn
in those days, and whether he eloped with one
of them or not, I never heard, but certain it was
that he disappeared, and no trace of him could
be found.</p>

<p>But after sin, remorse is sure to come, and
conscience speaks earnestly to the sinner, so “in
the stilly night,” when “slumber’s chains <i>had</i>
bound” the inmates of our house, some of them
were awakened by mournful and heart-rending
sounds coming from the rear of the house.
Under some circumstances, we might have
thought we were being serenaded; one of the
members of the household was despatched to
the back door, to admit the runaway! The lost
had returned! the prodigal had come home!
And as he rested once more on his couch of carpeting,
how sweet it must have smelled to him
(in which respect he would have differed from
us), and how soft it must have felt, because his
conscience was at rest, and because he could
once more sleep the sleep of the innocent! Some
of his feline friends had returned to the door
with him, and had uplifted their voices with his,
but only the proper inhabitant of the house was
admitted.</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>P.—PRENTISS, ELIZABETH.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IN a volume of nearly six hundred pages,
the husband of this gifted woman tells
the story of her life, or rather he lets her
tell it in extracts from her letters and journal.
In the little space allotted me for a sketch
of Mrs. Prentiss, I can only give you a few facts
of her life. When you are older you must read
this volume and learn more about her. She was
the daughter of a clergyman, a highly gifted
man, and one who was no less remarkable for
his piety than for his learning, and after reading
a sketch of Edward Payson, one is not surprised
that the daughter of such a man should develop
into a remarkable woman. Mrs. Prentiss was
born at Portland, Maine, October 26, 1818.
You would like to know about her as a child?
She is described as “a beautiful child, slender,
dark-eyed, light-footed, very quiet, evidently
observant, saying little, affectionate, yet not
demonstrative.”</div>

<p>She was devotedly attached to her father, and
the impression which the teachings of his beautiful,
godly life made upon her childish mind
was never effaced. Though he died when she
was only nine years old, her recollections of him
are said to have been remarkably vivid.</p>

<p>She could tell how he looked and talked and
acted, things he said and did. Once coming
upon him suddenly she found him engaged in
prayer, and so lost in communion with God that
he did not become conscious of her presence;
and she afterwards said that she never forgot
the scene, neither did its influence upon her
cease while she lived. She was never strong,
having inherited a nervous temperament along
with a feeble constitution. Once when she was
grown to womanhood she said, “I never knew
what it was to feel well.”</p>

<p>At the age of twelve years she was very ill
with a fever, so ill that the family thought the
hour had come when they must part with Elizabeth.
But she was spared, perhaps in answer
to the mother’s prayers, for that mother recorded
in her journal the circumstance of her illness
and restoration with a comment upon God’s
goodness in sparing the child, wondering whether
it might be to the end that she would one day
devote herself to the Saviour and do something
for the honor of religion. And in the spring of
the following year, this child of many prayers,
publicly confessed her faith in Christ, and was
enrolled among his people.</p>

<p>She grew to girlhood developing a lovely
Christian character, also showing a marked
talent in composition. She contributed when
quite young to the <i>Youth’s Companion</i>. As
she passed on through her girlhood into womanhood
she became her mother’s faithful friend
and assistant, thoughtful for her comfort, and
also a tender sympathizing friend towards her
brothers.</p>

<p>I want to copy for you a little bit of verse
which she wrote for the <i>Youth’s Companion</i>,
which I think will please some of our little
folks.</p>

<p class='poem'>
What are little babies for?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say! say! say!</span><br />
Are they good-for-nothing things?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay! nay! nay!</span><br />
Can they speak a single word?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say! say! say!</span><br />
Can they help their mother’s sew?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay! nay! nay!</span><br />
Can they walk upon their feet?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say! say! say!</span><br />
Can they even hold themselves?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay! nay! nay!</span><br />
What are little babies for?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Say! say! say!</span><br />
Are they made for us to love?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Yea!</i> <span class="smcap">yea!</span> YEA!!!</span><br />
</p>

<p>A friend says of her: “Human nature seems to
have been her favorite study. There seemed
to be no one in whom she could not find something
to interest her, none with whom there was
not some point of sympathy.”</p>

<p>And now I wonder if you have guessed, or if
you knew all the while that this remarkable
woman was the author of some of your favorite
books!</p>

<p>The Susy books! ah! your mothers will
tell you that these books were <i>their</i> favorites
as well as your own! <i>Susy’s Six Birthdays</i>
was published thirty-three years ago, then followed
the others of the series, and <i>Flower of
the Family</i>, and <i>Peterchen</i> and <i>Gretchen</i>, and
<i>Tangle Thread</i>, <i>Silver Thread</i> and <i>Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Thread</i>, besides many others, up to twenty-five
volumes. The book which has been more widely
read than any other of her works is probably
“Stepping Heavenward.”</p>

<p>More than seventy thousand copies have been
sold in this country, and the work has also
been translated into the French and German
languages.</p>

<p>Mrs. Prentiss’ books were all written after her
marriage to Rev. George L. Prentiss, which occurred
in 1845. Mr. Prentiss was the pastor of
a church in New Bedford. Afterwards they
lived in New York and, in the year 1866, they
went to a quiet place among the Green Mountains
to spend the summer, and so delighted
were they with the beauties of Dorset that they
made it their summer home, building a cottage
there in which Mrs. Prentiss died about twelve
years later.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give you any account of
the varied scenes of her life in such a brief
sketch. She was called to pass through many
sorrows. The death of the father to which I
have already referred; later the loss of her
mother, sister, brother and children.</p>

<p>These bereavements came one after another,
yet her Christian character only shone out the
brighter.</p>

<p>“Though the death of her children tore with
anguish the mother’s heart, she made no show of
grief, and to the eye of the world her life soon
appeared to move on as aforetime. Never
again, however, was it exactly the same life.
She had entered into the fellowship of Christ’s
sufferings and the new experience wrought a
great change in her whole being.” She was remarkably
happy in the children spared to her,
and in all her home life. A friend has written
of her:</p>

<p>“I have ever regarded her as favored among
women, blessed in doing her Master’s will and
in testifying of Him, blessed in her home, in her
friends, in her work and blessed in her death.”</p>

<h2>ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.</h2>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">By Margaret Sidney.</span></p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-g.jpg" width="55" height="111" alt="G" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">GEORGE EDWARD ALLEN was now
sixteen; hale, hearty, and full of fun.
Truth compels me to state that he did
not take first prize for English Composition,
Latin, Mathematics, or even for
general deportment, at the close of the summer
term just past. He had no gold medals to
carry home to his admiring parents, to be afterward
hung up in his room for the delectation of
any who might choose to examine. He was
only an industrious, even-tempered boy of ordinary
steady ability, but without the least capacity
for shining before a large audience with the
splendor of the examination hour.</div>

<p>He did have bestowed upon him, however, at
the last moment, in various little rencontres
with master and under teachers, several little
pleasant attentions that made his heart thrill,
and the warm blood mount his brown cheek.</p>

<p>“Allen, I must say I could give you a prize
for loving the right, with all my heart.” This
from the master, with that peculiar light in his
gray eyes that seldom came; and because so
seldom, was treasured deep by the one who
brought it there. He went further: “My boy,
I would give ten years of my life for such a son
as you are.” They were in a side recitation
room alone, and the master’s hand laid on the
lad’s shoulder, no one saw, much less heard the
words.</p>

<p>George Edward looked up quickly and gratefully.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the master. “If you want
any help in vacation over a tough spot in any
study, just drop me a hint of it.” There was a
smile in the overworked face, that lighted up
each hard line.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Allen,” said an under teacher regretfully,
as George Edward ran down the
passage, “I wish you were to be near me this
summer; I shall miss you,” and Mr. Bryan put
himself in the way of the boy’s advancement.
“I want to thank you for your good influence
in the class-room. For you have done more
than the teacher sometimes,” he frankly added.</p>

<p>George Edward tried to protest, but it was no
use. “Don’t be discouraged,” added the teacher
kindly, “if prizes do not fall to you now; but
keep on.”</p>

<p>“I should have liked to carry one home to
father and mother,” said George Edward honestly.</p>

<p>“Of course; who of us does not?” assented
Mr. Bryan. “Let me tell you though, my boy,
that the prizes, though late often, that fall to industry
and conscientious work, are better worth
getting. Take that with you to think of this
summer.”</p>

<p>The boys made loud protestations of regret,
which goes without saying, at the necessary
parting to come. How long the vacation
seemed, looking from the standpoint of June.
How impossible to wait till September before
George Edward’s round countenance should
burst upon them like a ray of sunshine, and his
cheery voice call to some sport, in which they
could see no hint of fun if he did not lead off.
But all things are finally pronounced ended.
So at last George Edward found himself at
home, with the only prospect of enjoyment
ahead of him, an invitation to visit at Uncle
Frost’s.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it’s all the outing we can give you
this summer, my boy,” said Mother Allen
soberly; “your father intended to take you if he
went on the Maine trip, but Mr. Porter wanted
the Western business done now, and that is altogether
too expensive to be thought of.”</p>

<p>George Edward’s eyes glistened. That
Western trip would have made a vacation beating
every other boy’s that he had known. He
broke out eagerly, “O mother—” then
stopped. She looked pale and troubled.</p>

<p>“It’s a good enough place at Uncle Frost’s,”
he finished indifferently; “when do I start?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t very pleasant,” said Mrs. Allen
truthfully. “I’m sorry you couldn’t have gone
into the country; but we can’t afford it unless I
go and shut up the house, and I can’t do that,
because grandma isn’t well, and must come
here.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said George Edward, “there’s
some fun in it, anyway. We’ll call it bully.”</p>

<p>“It will be a change,” said his mother, “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
that’s all you can say, and you’ll have a chance
to learn something new, and see other people.”</p>

<p>“When does he want me to come?” asked
George Edward, dashing at the letter again.</p>

<p>“Next week,” said Mrs. Allen.</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll put my traps together, and
be off. Gainesburg is the cry now,” cried
George Edward.</p>

<p>But for once the boy was in luck. Two days
after Uncle Frost’s house had received him, Mrs.
Allen was reading the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='unindent'>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Mother</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Hurrah—hurrah—hurrah! Uncle Frost is a brick (beg
pardon, mother)! He’s given me a royal, out-and-out invite to go
to the White Mountains with the family. Expenses all thrown
in, etc., etc. Start on Saturday. Telegraph “yes” please.</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: .5em;">Your affectionate Son,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">George Edward</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>“Yes” was telegraphed over the hills on
Thursday, and for two weeks our boy revelled
in the bliss of mountain life, with quantities of
fun, frolic and adventure thrown in by the way,
to return all made over, to Uncle Frost’s, there
to meet the ill news travelling fast over the
electric wires:</p>

<p>“Your father died suddenly at St. Paul.
Come at once.”</p>

<p>Had it come so soon? George Edward
looked life in the face this vacation time, accepted
his cross, bade good-by to all hopes of
ever entering school or college life again, and
thanked God for the situation in the drug store
that the apothecary around the corner gave
him.</p>

<p>His father’s affairs, well looked over, gave
no hope of anything but the direst economy
for the widow. As for the son, he must go to
work, and at once.</p>

<p>“Now we will see if he holds out a saint,”
one boy was mean enough to think, seeing
George Edward hurry to his place of work
every morning bright and early. Other eyes
quite as sharp, though far from cruel, were on
him. It was an awful ordeal for any boy to pass
through; most of all, because of the commonplaceness
of the sacrifice he was daily making.
Had he marched up to the cannon’s mouth, and
courted death to save his mother’s life, this
would have been easy compared to the monotonous
dead-level existence he was enduring. For
to the active boy, alert for an excitement, wide
awake for novelty, with every muscle crying out
for exercise and change, the close confinement
of the small store, and the routine work, were
torture indeed. He began to show the effects of
such a life, and in three weeks his mother was
aghast to find that her boy had grown suddenly
thin and pale.</p>

<p>“Why, George Edward,” she cried, “you
can’t stay in that store.”</p>

<p>“I must,” said George Edward doggedly.</p>

<p>“But you will die,” cried poor Mrs. Allen,
“then what shall I do?” And the tears began
to come.</p>

<p>George Edward thought a bit. Then he said
“There isn’t anything else, mother, only work
on a farm. But it’s August now, who’d give
me a chance at it, pray tell?”</p>

<p>“I shall try,” said his mother, rousing herself,
“you will die where you are.” And she seized
paper and pen and wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A boy of sixteen who has just lost his father wishes a place
to work on a farm for the remainder of the season. Only those
persons of unexceptional references who wish such a farm hand
not afraid to work, need apply to</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Mrs. E. C. Allen</span>,<br />
—— ——<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>George Edward was in a fever of excitement,
though he tried not to show it, all the next three
days. His mother met with such poor success
in her efforts to conceal her state of mind, that
she went around the house, a bright spot in
either cheek, scarcely able to set herself with
calmness at any task. At last, on the evening
of the third day, this letter was drawn from the
post-office:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Respected Madam</span>:</p>

<p>If your son really wants to work, send him on. Here’s a
letter from my paster, maybe that will be satisfyin’. Three
dollars a week an’ board. That’s what I pay. Yours to command,</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Job Stevens</span>,</span><br />
<i>Blueberry Hill</i>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The “paster’s” letter reading remarkably
well, and a friend investigating the matter with
thoroughness for Mrs. Allen, finding it all right,
George Edward’s trunk was packed, and he at
once dispatched for Blueberry Hill.</p>

<p>It was evening when he arrived there.</p>

<h2>QUEEN ELIZABETH.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-q.jpg" width="73" height="91" alt="Q" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">QUEEN ELIZABETH was the daughter
of the wicked Henry the Eighth and of
Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth was about three
years old when she was left motherless. On the
death of her sister Mary she ascended to the
throne, and amid joyful acclamations was proclaimed
queen.</div>

<p>As the grand procession moved along the
queen was very kind and gracious, and the poor
came up to her carriage, with nosegays for her,
and when any one wanted to speak to her, she
would stop the carriage. The coronation took
place at Westminster. The crown was placed
upon her head amidst great shouting and rejoicing.
Elizabeth placed a ring upon her own
finger, to signify that she was espoused to the
realm of England, and that ring she wore for
forty years.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was a fine scholar, and in many
respects her reign was prosperous, but she was
very irritable, and did several things which have
marred and stained her name.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus063.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="the abbey" />
<div class="caption">WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</div>
</div>

<p>Of course there is very much to learn about
her which you must read yourself in history.
You will there be told all about her troubles
with the unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots,
who was her relative, and who after being a
prisoner in Fotheringay Castle for many years,
was executed.</p>

<p>She was very beautiful. It is thought that
Elizabeth envied her remarkable beauty, which
is a very wicked thing to do. Elizabeth, though
homely, was very vain, and dearly loved compliments.</p>

<p>At one time there were many pictures of the
queen circulated, much resembling her, and
therefore not very handsome. So the queen
issued a formal proclamation against them, forbidding
the people to sell them, and stating that
an artist would be employed to make a true
picture of her. What a pity she did not realize
that beauty of mind, kindness of heart, nobleness
of character, and above all, the true Christian
spirit, were much more to be desired than
anything so frail and perishable as human beauty.
Never, in any reign, has England known such
pomp and splendor as in Elizabeth’s time. She
was fond of parade. She once went to church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
surrounded by a thousand men in armor, and
drums and trumpets sounding.</p>

<div class="caption">QUEEN ELIZABETH. (<i>From painting in the English National
Portrait Gallery.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>You will read in her life about the Earl of
Essex, who was a prime favorite with Elizabeth
for a long time, but he offended her, and she
caused him to be executed. She had once given
him a ring, to be returned to her in case he
ever needed her aid. When in prison he sent it,
but it was intercepted. The queen got angry
because the ring did not come, and therefore
thought Essex was very proud. After his
death, however, she learned about the ring, and
was therefore thrown into deep distress, and
soon pined away and died. She had about three
thousand dresses at the time of her death, in
her wardrobe. Her last words were, “Millions
of worlds for an inch of time.”</p>

<p>She was buried in Westminster Abbey, where
many of the great of England sleep in unbroken
repose.</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>S.—SAVONAROLA, GIROLAMO.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="57" height="111" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">FOUR hundred and thirty-four years—1452-1886.
What wonderful events
have been taking place all along through
these years since the young Girolamo
first saw the light! And I have been
wondering what Savonarola would have said
and done had he lived in this nineteenth century.
He is spoken of as one whose soul was
stirred by ardent faith which burned through
all obstacles; as a fervid orator and as a sagacious
ruler, who evolved order out of chaos; as
one who to maintain his cause of reform braved
single-handed the whole power of the Papacy.
He is described as a serious, quiet child, early
showing signs of mental power. The books
which were his favorites would, I fear, be pronounced
dry by the boys of to-day. But although
he was given to solid reading, he was
fond of music and poetry, and even wrote verses
himself. He enjoyed solitude, and loved to
wander alone along the banks of the River Po.
I ought to have told you that his native city was
Ferrara, in Italy. He was expected to succeed
his grandfather who was an eminent physician,
and with that end in view he was carefully
trained. But as he grew older, he found himself
growing to regard the thought with disfavor,
and as time went on he became convinced
that “his vocation was to cure men’s souls instead
of men’s bodies.” Yet he was for a long
time restrained from entering upon the priesthood
by regard for the hopes and desires of his
parents. But at length after having made this
his daily prayer, “Lord, teach me the way my
soul must walk,” the path of duty became clear
and he, avoiding the painful farewells, slipped
away from home one day when the rest of the
family were absent at a festival, writing an affectionate
note of explanation and farewell.
He entered a monastery at Bologna, where he
gave himself up to the work of special preparation
for the duties of his profession.</div>

<p>After some years he was sent to Florence to
preach. At first his plain and severe denunciations
of the prevailing sins of the time repelled
the people who preferred to go where they could
hear more polished and less conscience-awakening
sermons, and Savonarola mourned over his
apparent failure to reach the hearts of the multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
who were rushing on in the ways of sinful
indulgence. But his soul was moved with zeal
“for the redemption of the corrupt Florentines.
He must, he would, stir them from their lethargy
of sin.” He was convinced that he was in the
line of duty, and the more indifferent his hearers
were the more anxious he grew for their
awakening. Actuated by this motive he suddenly
found his voice and revealed his powers
as an orator. God had shown him how to reach
men’s hearts at last, and “he shook men’s souls
by his predictions and brought them around him
in panting, awestruck crowds;” then at the close
of his denunciations of sin, his voice would sink
into tender pleading and sweetly he would speak
of the infinite love and mercy of God the Father.</p>

<p>After a time, St. Mark’s Church would not
hold the crowds which came to hear him and he
was invited to preach in the Cathedral. He was
now acknowledged as a power in Florence, and
the great Lorenzo de’ Medici who was then at
the height of his fame as a ruler, was alarmed,
and he sent a deputation of five of the leaders
of the government to advise the monk to be
more moderate in his preaching, hinting that
trouble might follow a disregard of this advice.
But the monk was unmoved. He replied, “Tell
your master that although I am an humble
stranger and he the city’s lord, yet I shall remain
and he will depart.” He also declared that he
owed his election to God, and not to Lorenzo,
and to God alone would he render obedience.</p>

<p>Lorenzo was very angry, but he tried to silence
the monk by bribery, but Savonarola would not
be bribed nor driven. He continued to preach
with great fervor, denouncing sin in high places
as well as in low. You know that in those times
corruption had crept into the Church of Christ,
and it was against these sins of the Church that
his most scathing denunciations were hurled.
He had many followers, and he pushed his reforms
in Church and State. His enemies grew
more bitter and fiercer. Remonstrances from
those in authority had no effect. He was offered
a cardinal’s hat, but would not accept the conditions.
He said, “I will have no hat but that of
the martyr, red with mine own blood.”</p>

<p>And this was his fate; at last he was put to
death in 1498. Almost his last words were,
“You cannot separate me from the Church
triumphant! that is beyond thy power.” In the
convent of St. Mark’s are preserved various
relics of the martyred monk, among which are
his Bible with notes by his own hand, and a portrait
said to have been painted by Fra Bartolommeo.
I have seen a copy of this portrait. It is
in profile, with the Friar’s cowl. At the first
glance the expression of the prominent features
seems strangely stern, but as you study the face
it seems to soften and the sternness becomes
sadness mingled with tenderness. One can
imagine those worn and pallid features lighted
up with excitement, the eyes animated and
glowing with zeal, and the lips so expressive of
power, relaxing into a smile even, and thus looking
upon it we wonder not that crowds hung
upon his words.</p>

<p>Hatred of sin, zeal for its removal from
Church and State, seems to have been two of his
strong characteristics. And he was ever bold
and active in lifting up and carrying forward
the standard of truth. If sometimes his zeal
outran his wisdom and judgment, if sometimes
his enthusiasm seemed to reach what we might
call a religious frenzy in which he heard supernatural
voices and saw visions, we can but
believe in his sincerity and admire his boldness
and commend his fearless exposure of sin. And
as we study his character again and again we
wonder as in the beginning of this sketch, how
he would have acted in these days when sin
“comes in like a flood!” Have we not need of a
Savonarola? Have we not need of an army of
strong, fearless men and women who shall lift
up the standard of the Gospel against the tide
of sin? One thought more: will each of my
young readers enlist in this army and be diligent
in preparing to meet the attacks of the enemy?</p>

<p class='drop-cap'>THORWALDSEN was a Danish sculptor.
Returning from Italy to his native land,
he brought a great number of lovely works of
art, which he packed in straw. When unpacked,
the straw was strewn about the streets, and it
so happened that it contained a great many seed.
These took root, and before long flowers were
blooming in Copenhagen, from those very seed.
Every hour we are scattering seed: see that it

<span class="smcap">My Dear Pansies</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>The game for this Midsummer “month of
evenings,” is one that I especially commend to
you. It will be enjoyed so very much longer after
it has been played, and years to come whenever
you think of the happy hour it engrossed you,
you will always be very glad that you and your
little friends played it.</p>

<p>This is the game:</p>

<p class='center'>
<span class="smcap">THE WHEELING PARTY.</span><br />
</p>

<p>All who have carriages, or wagons, and a
faithful horse or two in the generous barns at
home, ask your father or uncle if they will loan
them to you for an hour after supper on a pleasant
evening, that all the players may choose.
Those who have no wagons, or anything that a
horse could draw, need not be debarred from
joining in this game; possibly they can contribute
a large cart, that they could propel themselves
or, a boy not easily baffled, might join the
procession, with an improvised floor on wheels
on which soft cushions are piled.</p>

<p>At any rate, let the procession be formed, of
every “go-able vehicle,” superintended by
careful drivers, and where the space admits,
carrying happy, merry-voiced children to make
the poor invalids forget their sufferings.</p>

<p>Invalids? Yes, indeed, this is the “Invalids
Wheeling Party,” the blessedest invention of
modern times. The “Shut-in Society” brought
out for a breath of fresh air—God’s poor children,
who for wise reasons of His, are serving
Him in narrow rooms of want, now, by the kind
hands of children, admitted to the sweet peace
of the summer eventide.</p>

<p>Do you not know them—these patient invalids?
living perhaps very near to you. There
is the little lame boy—the washerwoman’s son,
who when she goes out to her work, minds the
baby, and tries in his poor way to help mother.
“Dot-and-go-one” you and the other children
perhaps call him.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it vary proceedings a bit if you
were to send him a little note, saying something
like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='unindent'>
<span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Will you go to ride after supper with Frank and me?</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Egbert.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Or, there is old Mrs. Clemens. She is not
pleasant-looking, to be sure; snuffy and disagreeable
in her ways also. But she has not
stepped out of her cottage only to go as far as
the woodpile in five years. Think of it! Suppose
now Mrs. Clemens should find under her
door some fine morning a little white note in
which the old lady should read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='unindent'>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Clemens</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Mary Alice Smith and I would like to give you a ride this
evening after supper in my father’s wagon. I hope you can go.</p>

<p class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Susan Embury.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Don’t you suppose the Clemens cottage would
be a new place all that day?</p>

<p>And so on. Even if you do not personally
know who is needing these sweet country drives,
some one will be brought to your notice on
inquiry.</p>

<p>When the procession is formed, let some one
lead who is intelligent, as to the choice of a delightful
locality (for invalids like to see something
new and pretty), and the best way for getting
there.</p>

<p>Then while the greatest cheerfulness prevails
let there be no unnecessary noise, I beseech you,
for your guests are unaccustomed to excitement,
and are easily wearied. There should be sweet
attentions, little courtesies, and the feeling of
real enjoyment of giving hospitality on your
part, but all done and expressed quietly.</p>

<p>Try it, dear Pansies, this little game, and see
if you do not often play it these lovely summer
evenings. I doubt not you will enjoy it as
much as the invited guests of “The Wheeling
Party.”</p>

<p><i>Willie</i> from New York. My boy, I sent you
the last badge a short time ago. I hope they
are now all right. Let me hear from your
society as often as you have anything interesting
to tell us.</p>

<p><i>Esca</i> from Illinois. So you think you need
more “sticktoativeness”! Good! Ever so
many people do. I counted no less than ten
different pieces of work which a boy of my
acquaintance had commenced, and never finished.
They were all worth finishing too. What a pity!
Imagine a dress all done but the sleeves!
Mammas do not work in that way; do they?</p>

<p><i>Maude</i> from Nebraska. Your letter was not
too long, my dear; I was interested in it all. I
have known a number of wise small people who,
like yourself, made a great deal of trouble for
themselves and their best friends, by trying to
have their own way. It is generally a foolish
thing to do. You must remember that it is not
only “poor people” who are in need of kind acts
and words. Some of the most unhappy persons
I ever met, had plenty of money. What they
needed was sympathy, and a few gentle, helpful
words.</p>

<p><i>Carrie</i> from Indian Territory. My dear
Blossom, struggling with your little garden
away off from us, how glad we were to hear
from you! It is the same old story, though,
which we hear from all over the country; cross
little tongues, speaking words that hurt, and
for which they are sorry afterwards, and all
because Dame Passion gets hold of them, and
for the time makes them her slaves! Little
Pixie too has her troubles. It is very hard not
to be selfish; especially if we are surrounded by
grown people who have been at work for a long
time, teaching us to be selfish, by giving up
everything for our pleasure. And there is little
brother Tippie, wanting his own way, dreadfully!
What busy gardeners you will have to be
working at all these weeds! If you were to sit
down and let them grow, I am afraid your buds
would soon be choked. I am glad you are not
going to do this.</p>

<p><i>Amelia</i> from Indian Territory. What a
beautiful pledge you have taken! If you “do
your duty in all things as long as you live,” you
will be sure to be one of whom I can be always
proud. I should like to hear from you often;
and will always be glad to receive from you the
history of some of your “kind words” spoken
for Jesus’ sake.</p>

<p><i>Walter</i> from New York. It was a grand idea
to join us on your birthday. I think the “lessons”
must have felt the influence of that
pledge. To be as good a boy as one can, is
promising a great deal, but not too much if one
is in tremendous earnest, as I think you are.
We enroll your name with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> from Vermont. I like your pledge; so
many people ask useless questions, wasting
their time, and the patience of their friends, it
is well to break the habit while you are young.
A gentleman called on me the other day who
had the same habit; he asked half a dozen
questions, any one of which he might have
answered for himself if he had used his eyes,
and after sitting for half an hour, he turned to
me and asked three of them over again!</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> from New Hampshire. Your promise
covers a great deal of ground. If you keep it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
you will be a true woman as long as you live. I
like your verses, and will print them in <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span> as soon as we have room. I hope you
find your badge helpful.</p>

<p><i>Grace</i> from New York. I could not have received
the letter you mention. I am glad you
wrote again. What a large pledge you have
taken! To “do better in everything,” is surely
worth one’s while. Your society needs no name
but P. S. We are all branches of the great
Pansy Society which reaches all over the country.</p>

<p><i>Sarah</i> from New York. We are glad to welcome
you; may you be successful in your efforts,
as you surely will be if you live by the Whisper
Motto.</p>

<p><i>Clara</i> from Nebraska. I found your letter so
full of helpful hints, my dear, that I have copied
from it for the magazine. I am glad you find
the badge a help.</p>

<p><i>Josephine</i>, <i>Josephine</i>, <i>Mary</i>, <i>Robbie</i>, from New
York. A bouquet of Blossoms pledged to do
battle against the weeds in their heart-gardens.
May you all succeed, and be fragrant flowers
that shall give pleasure wherever you go, and
bloom forever in the garden above. This is
Pansy’s prayer for all her Blossoms.</p>

<p><i>Florence</i> from Ohio. The author of “My Brainless
Acquaintance” sends you thanks for your
kind opinion of him. He will try to interest
you again. I am glad you find <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>
helpful in school. Look out for some lovely recitations
in it.</p>

<p><i>Lillia</i> from Connecticut. I hope the badges
have been made right long ago. I do not remember
about it now, but I suppose the delay
came from getting out of badges. So many P.
S. Blossoms sprang up at once all over the
country, that the first we knew, they had gotten
ahead of us. I am much interested in your
society, and would like to hear from it again. I
will quote from your letter for the magazine,
that some other Pansies may get a hint from it
how to employ their time.</p>

<p><i>Mabel</i> from Dakota. You have a great deal
of company, my dear Mabel, in the matter of
wanting your own way. So that you are sure
it is the <i>right</i> way, I don’t believe anybody will
object. Shall I tell you how to be sure of getting
it? Have your way always <i>exactly</i> what
will most honor Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Claude</i> from New York. Yes, I was once in
Castile, and at Miss Green’s; I loved her dearly,
and owe her a great debt of gratitude. I shall
certainly come and see you if I visit your town.
I think I would like about a bushel of those
“black caps.” So your hasty temper troubles
you? Temper is a very good thing if we put it
under the right Master. Take yours to Him,
and ask Him to guard it for you.</p>

<p><i>Pearl</i> from Indiana. My dear, I think you
must have a lovely walk through the woods to
school. I am glad you have decided to have
nothing to do with cards; I once heard a good
man say: “They belong to the enemy’s country;
they gather under the flag which is a sign
of rebellion to King Jesus, so I will have nothing
to do with them.” I think that would be a
very good rule for the Pansies to follow. Whatever
Satan makes marked use of, to injure others,
I will not touch.</p>

<p><i>Lita</i> from Illinois. I hope you will succeed
in overcoming the fault. There is a sense in
which it makes no difference whether or not I
know its name. You know, and Jesus knows;
but if the Pansies choose to tell us, it sometimes
helps others.</p>

<p><i>Alice and Emma</i> from Wisconsin. Since you
are dear friends, and wrote me together, you
will let me reply in the same way. I am glad
to welcome you both to our P. S. Glad also to
hear that you both love and serve the Lord
Jesus. I hope your lives will be full of fragrance,
and suggest His name to all who know you.</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> from Connecticut. I don’t know when
I have enjoyed a story more than the pleasant
one you wrote me about that industrious society.
It told me a great many things; among others,
that you have dear helpful mothers, and friends.
What should we do in this world without the
mothers who stand ready to help every effort of
ours toward usefulness, or right living? I hope
you heard from the dolls. Write and tell us
how they were enjoyed.</p>

<p><i>Milly</i> from Pennsylvania. What a very fine
beginning of a library you have! I wish you
had told us how you managed the books and
what class of books you had. How do you raise
your money? When you hear from some of
those colored schools, will you tell us what they
said to the help you sent them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hermon</i> from Massachusetts. Prompt obedience
is a very important habit to form. It is a
pleasure to me to notice how many young people
are resolved upon cultivating it. I think
“Moses” has a responsible life to live if he is to
do honor to his name. I am not sure but
“Aaron” was wise in running away. At least,
one can overlook running away from duty when
it is only a dog; but what shall be said of a boy
or girl who does the same?</p>

<p><i>Finice</i> from Kentucky. Is that the right
name? I am not sure. “Hard lessons” make
a great deal of trouble in this world; but I know
a secret about them: they become easy as soon
as they are learned; so for one’s own sake it is
worth while to overcome them. Sometimes,
schoolmates are very provoking, and it is hard
to keep one’s temper with them; but the boy or
girl who does it soon acquires an influence over
his mates that others cannot have. I hope you
know where to look for help in keeping these
pledges?</p>

<p><i>Fannie</i> from Kentucky. Do you think “all”
little girls would really like to overcome their
faults? I have seen some young people whose
gravest fault seemed to me to be that they cared
very little about improving their habits, or getting
control of their tongues or tempers. I welcome
you as one who is not of that company.</p>

<p><i>Chester</i> from Oregon. A “treasurer” is a
very important officer in the P. S., my boy, provided
they have any money to care for; and
most of the societies have. They contrive ways
of earning money, to spend in benevolent work
of some sort. It depends entirely on yourselves
how you will raise money, to what you will devote
it, and how you will manage your society.
As a rule, the one who secures subscribers and
starts a club, becomes president; but if he, or
she, thinks some other person would make a
better officer, one can be elected from the membership.
I like your pledge. The truth is, a
boy who has a good mother, and who always
minds her promptly, is sure to be a boy to
honor.</p>

<p><i>Lois</i> from Kentucky. “Cross” words make
a great deal of trouble in this world. Did you
ever notice that they not only hurt the ones to
whom they are spoken, and the ones who hear
them, but also those who speak them! What a
pity to cling to a habit which hurts in every
direction! I am glad you are going to be free.</p>

<p><i>Lillie</i>, <i>Edna</i>, <i>Harry</i>, <i>Walter</i>, <i>Rose</i>, <i>Thad</i>,
from Kansas. A full bouquet which bloomed
together! We welcome you, every one. Let
me see what weeds are to be rooted out; “Getting
angry and answering back,” “Forgetting
work,” “Carelessness,” “Speaking cross words,”
“Being too noisy.” Just imagine what earnest
work will have to be done in getting rid of all
these choking weeds! Besides these, one Blossom
is going to keep careful watch over a set of
pearls which have been given her for her own
use. She knows that if she takes proper care
of them they will be beautiful and helpful all
her life; and that if she neglects them, they will
become her enemies. I wish you all great success,
and will hope to hear from you.</p>

<p><i>Freddie</i> from New York. So you have a
watch to prove to you what a little persevering
work will accomplish? Good! The people who
get discouraged seldom accomplish much. I
hope your temper will, after this, keep as good
time as your watch; and that you will be as
prompt to follow orders as <i>it</i> is to tick. My
boy, you have a special work to do for your
mother, in trying to fill your dear father’s place
as much as you can. I hope you will be one of
her greatest blessings.</p>

<p><i>Mattie and Philemon</i> from Georgia. A “careless”
Blossom and an “impatient” one starting
together! Good! I fancy that the careless ways
may sometimes provoke the impatient words;
and so you two can surely help each other.
We shall hope to hear of your great success.</p>

<p><i>Frank</i> from Massachusetts. “Kind words”
are needed everywhere, my boy; but I do not
know that they will do more good anywhere
than at school among the scholars. I have often
wondered at the rough words I heard floating
out on the air as I passed playgrounds. If one
boy sets an example of kindness and courtesy to
all the young people around him, who can tell
how the habit may spread, and cause many Blossoms
to spring up?</p>

<p><i>Davenport</i> from Massachusetts. Glad to
welcome you; I hope your badge is helping you
in all the ways in which you need help. Thank
your kind sister for writing in your name. I
think she is a very excellent writer for one so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
young. Let me hear what you are doing, in
which your badge has been a help.</p>

<p><i>Arthur</i> from New Jersey. Ever so many
people “don’t want to do the thing which they
ought next to do.” Did you know that? the
great difference between them is, that some people
seize hold of the thing they didn’t want to
do, and do it; while some growl around, or
whine around, and leave it undone as long as
they can. I am glad to know you are, from
this time, to belong to the first class.</p>

<p><i>Robbie</i> from New York. I am very glad to
welcome you to the P. S. I am much interested
in the club of which you are a member, and
would be glad to hear from it from time to
time. You did not give me the special habit
which you are trying to conquer, but I suppose
you know, very well, which it is, and are doing
brave work over it.</p>

<p><i>Florence</i> from New York. When you “get
the better” of your temper, and are its mistress
instead of being controlled by it, what a happy
Blossom you will be! Some people do not think
this can be done, but I am sure it can by any
one who truly wishes to do so, and seeks and
finds the right sort of help.</p>

<p><i>Kimball</i> from Illinois. Welcome to our garden.
“Talking back” is a weed which chokes
many flowers; quite hides their sweetness oftentimes.
Root it out. Thank you for the kind
invitation. I should like to accept it, but fear
I will not have time. Will you give my love to
grandma, and all the dear ones, and thank them
for their kind words to me?</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM PANSY LETTERS.</h2>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</p>

<p>I would like to become a member of the P. S.
I am a little girl seven years old. My mamma
is an invalid and I am hands and feet for her as
she sits in her invalid chair. I have a brother
and sister in Heaven.</p>

<p>My little sister Nellie was four years and a
half old when she died. She would have made
a good member of the P. S., for mamma says
she took for her motto in everything, “For
Jesus’ sake.” One day, before she was sick,
she said to mamma, “Me do love Jesus <i>so</i> much,
mamma, me want to go see Him, and sing praise
to Him.” Then she would hold out her little
arms, as though she was reaching up to some one,
and ask mamma when she thought God would
send for her. One morning after looking at a
sunrise, she said, “Mamma, it looks like the
golden streets of Heaven.” I wanted to write
to you about this little sister, for I thought she
would have made such a dear little Pansy. Now
she is a Blossom in God’s garden.</p>

<p>I live on a farm, but it is right by a little
village. I play with lambs, and ducks, and
calves. My chickens follow me around and get
under my feet sometimes, so I can scarcely walk.
I can pick them up and pat them, any time. I
wish to overcome two bad habits: selfishness
and whining. I had a gold ring to help me
keep from whining; I had it last fall, and it
cured me until this spring; then the habit come
back so bad I had to give mamma the ring.
Now I am going to try what the badge and
motto will do. I’ve tried the motto before, and
it <i>always</i> helped. But someway, dear Pansy, I
do not always keep hold of the Help. Mamma
says she thinks it might do grown people good
to belong to a Pansy Society. We have a great
many of your books in our home. Mamma gets
a new one every year; we lend them to people
to read. I hope I have not tired you with my
letter.</p>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</p>

<p>We are two little brothers away down in Va.
We have taken <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> for four years. We
like it more and more, and we love you very
much. We have two bad habits. We don’t
keep things in place and we dispute with each
other. We found a bumblebee’s house in a
part of an old barn. It had fifteen apartments
and two ways of entering them. The doors
were little round caps which looked something
like stiff, dark brown paper. Our love for you
and all the Blossoms.</p>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</p>

<p>The boys in our society are making banners
and books for the children in the hospital. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
girls are sewing dresses for the little orphans
who are found; they have hardly any clothes to
cover them when they are found. Our Sunday-school
teacher has taken a great deal of interest
in our society. She has given us twenty-three
books, and a great many cards. We have
learned a good many missionary hymns from the
cards. We have a library of sixty-three books;
and a friend is going to give us some more.
We meet every Saturday at my house; we are
going to use our money to help provide schools
for little colored children. There are about
thirty members of our society. We all want to
see you; we wish you would come and visit us.
We will be much obliged to see you any Saturday
between half-past two and half-past five. I
must bid you good-by.</p>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</p>

<p>I would like to join the P. S. And I will try
to overcome the habit of talking back. I am
afraid I will have hard work and will need much
help. I have taken <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> for four years,
and I like it ever so much. I like “Reaching
Out” the best of all. Mother thinks “Hedge
Fence” was the best, for boys. I have been in
school for two winters. I am nine years old.
I belong to a Bible class.</p>

<p>With a little of grandma’s help, I got ten
new subscribers for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. When you go
West, won’t you stop off and make us a visit?
Because you would find lots of friends here.
There are four of us in this family, grandma,
papa, mamma, and I. And we will all be glad
to see you. We all feel acquainted with you,
because we have two of your pictures, and lots
of your books.</p>

<p>Mamma says if I am a Pansy I must be a
bronze one. Can you guess why? Some time
I will tell you “Where I Went and What I
Saw,” in a summer trip; but this summer I am
to be one of the “stay at homes.”</p>

<p class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</p>

<p>In “Where I Went, and What I Saw,” you
once told about some Bible verses, the first letters
of which would spell “Our Sabbath School.”</p>

<p>I thought I would find some like them:—</p>

<p>I am trying to overcome my habits very hard.
My great fault is to get mad so easy. And
sometimes I pout when I get mad. I go off by
myself, often, and ask the Lord to help me to
quit such a habit. Please help me to overcome
such a fault. Now my little sister Pixie wants
to belong to our Band. Her fault is selfishness;
she thinks she ought to have everything that is
pretty. She tries to tear my <span class="smcap">Pansies</span> every
time she gets them. Still, she loves to read
them. Mamma and I think they are ever so
nice. I won’t let Pixie have my <span class="smcap">Pansies</span> because
I want to keep them nice; she says
mamma ought to subscribe for her. I hope she
will grow better as she grows older; she is very
young. Now my brother Tippie, he wants to

to do. But mamma says he isn’t contrary with
anybody but Pixie and me. Please let me have
a letter of my own from you.</p>

liked. I am going to have my magazines bound.
I like the story “My Brainless Acquaintance”

<h2>A FAMILY FLIGHT THROUGH SPAIN.</h2>

<p class='drop-cap'>DID you carefully read what I said about the
Horners in their flight through Egypt
and Syria? And do you remember it in detail,
as to price, appearance, etc? No, of course you
don’t. Who ever heard of these giddy girls and
boys remembering anything for a month? Oh!
Oh! I can hear your indignant voices. Well,
that is too bad; and I believe in my heart as
many of you as sent for the book and read it,
have a very vivid and delightful memory of the
family and their experiences. But for the benefit
of the new Pansies, and of those who could
not or did not send for the other book, let me
introduce you to this one by the same authors,
and offer it to you on the same excellent terms:
one dollar and twenty cents, if you are willing
to have it bound in boards, and one dollar and
fifty cents if you want it in cloth. Remember,
that is a dollar cheaper than any others can get
it; a special offer to the members of the P. S.</p>

<p>I had no idea that Spain was so interesting a
country until I travelled with the Horners. I
think now that it makes a very great difference
about one’s enjoyment in travelling, who their
companions are. I am very fond of Bessie
Horner, and for that matter of Tommy himself,
while Mr. Hervey is fully as good a friend of
mine as he is of the other travellers. This
beautiful book which gives the story of the
flight through Spain, is very fully illustrated,
giving one an excellent idea of the country, its
birds, its fruits, its buildings, etc. For instance,
take this description of</p>


<h3>THE ALHAMBRA.</h3>

<p>Under the Moors, the Alhambra was the
scene of many romantic events, the legends connected
with which still people its courts with
phantoms. The road leading up from the hotel
to the entrance is shaded with tall trees, and the
water trickles down the side, making the grass
fresh and green. The walls are of a beautiful
red or orange color, which is shared by the soil;
this alone gives a glowing aspect to the scene.
The chief place of entrance is called the Gate
of Justice. It is more than a gate, being a
square tower, the upper part of which contains
rooms where people live. Their little flower
pots filled with bright blossoms, stand on the
ledge of the window. The horseshoe arch of
entrance is below; for as the ground is terraced,
the level of the palace is above that of the arch,
and is approached by an ascent, and a staircase
within the tower.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/illus085.jpg" width="344" height="530" alt="courtyard with fountain" />
<div class="caption">COURT OF LIONS. (<i>From Family Flight through Spain.</i>)</div>
</div>

<p>Over this arch there is carved an outstretched
hand pointing upward, to avert the evil eye;
over the second one a key is sculptured; a symbol
of the power of the prophet to open and shut
the gates of heaven. The passages within the
tower wind about under several arches, until
they lead out and up to the walled-in plateau,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>on which the Alhambra stands. A little farther
on is another gateway, and building, called the
Puerto del Vino; it formerly contained a Mihrab,
or Moorish chapel.</p>

<p>From the high terrace near these two gates
is a lovely view across the deep ravine to the
Sierra Nevada, always slightly touched with
snow, and taking on beautiful lights, according
to the time of day: dark blue in the morning,
and, as evening approaches, roseate; for in addition
to the sunset tints, the natural color of
the soil and stone make the tone of the range
warm and rich. Here opens a large plaza, called
the Place of the Cisterns, on one side of which
is the Alcazaba, or fortress, with its dismantled
castle, while opposite it appears the palace of
Charles the Fifth, which he began to build, but
never finished. He destroyed the greater part
of the beautiful winter palace of the Moors, to
make room for his own, and afterward abandoned
his plan, leaving the unfinished ruin, with
open arches, staring to the sky. It is said that
earthquakes discouraged him from going on with
his palace. There are planted garden beds, and
walks leading along the side of it, to a plain,
unadorned wall, through which a door leads to
the real glories of the Alhambra.</p>

<p>Here found themselves one morning, Mr. Horner
and Miss Lejeune, Bessie and Tommy; Bessie
grumbling, as usual, at Charles the Fifth, and
Ferdinand and Isabella, who have left their
traces so often in the destruction of Moorish ornament.</p>

<p>“I do believe,” said Bessie, “that Isabella
herself rode on a whitewash brush!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she was the—</p>

<p class='poem'>
Old woman, old woman, said I,<br />
To sweep the cobwebs from the sky!“<br />
</p>

<p class='unindent'>said Tommy.</p>

<p>They passed on through the gate. Charles
the Fifth and Isabella were forgotten. The
transition was magical; they felt at once transported
into other times, and were treading the
scenes of the Arabian Nights. They were in the
Court of Myrtles, a long, open patio, of which
the floor is taken up by an immense basin, more
than a hundred feet long, bordered by myrtle-trees
and roses. It is surrounded by a light
arcade of Moorish columns, and at the upper
end rises the great Tower of Comares. The
pillars here and elsewhere are of extreme lightness,
and the ornamentation of the capital varies
in each; slender arches spring from the capitals,
and bend gracefully till they meet. A dado of
azulejos, or colored tiles, runs along the wall,
from the floor of brightest colors, with great
variety of patterns. The eye is never tired of following
these designs, nor those of the arabesque
work above, into which are woven Arabic sentences,
in the graceful lettering of that language.
Across the water is seen the vista made by the
entrance to the Hall of Ambassadors, the chief
room of the Tower of Comares. The tower and
its colonnades are reflected in the clear still
water of the pool.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” exclaimed Miss Lejeune.
“This surpasses all my dreams of it.”</p>

<p>“Let us stay here, and not go any further to-day!”
said Bessie.</p>

<p>Tommy was well content to study the goldfish
in the clear water, rather startled, as he
leaned over, to catch the perfect reflection of his
own face on the surface of the pool, with behind
it an intensely blue sky studded with woolly
white clouds. He looked up instinctively, and
saw above the graceful fretwork of the court,
the real bright sky and clouds, just like the mirrored
ones.</p>

<p>“Our guide apparently expects us to move
on,” remarked Mr. Horner. “We can let him
gallop us through once, and then come at our
leisure as often as we like.”</p>

<p>“Not gallop us, papa,” said Bessie, taking
hold of his hand; “a quiet little trot will satisfy
him.”</p>

<p>They were led into the Court of Lions, where
Bessie was at once in love with the somewhat
clumsy animals of Arab origin, that form the
group of the fountain in the centre.</p>

<p>“I must embrace this one!” she cried, and
did so, to Tommy’s disgust and mortification.
He looked round to see if there were any observers.</p>

<p>These lions must not be looked upon as efforts
of sculpture to represent accurately the king of
beasts, but as emblems of strength and courage.
They are of white marble, with manes like the
scales of a griffin, and water comes from their
mouths.</p>

<p>The book, “Cookery for Beginners,” has always been cataloged and sold in
cloth binding at the low price of $1.00. But we have made a new edition in oiled,
waterproof paper covers, containing the same matter and same number of pages as
the previous editions. It consists of plain, practical lessons for girls and young
housekeepers of small means. Its directions are to be relied upon, and its results
are invariably delicate, wholesome and delicious. It possesses the advantage of
being perfectly adapted to the needs of beginners. Mothers cannot give their
daughters a more sensible and useful present than this volume. It is a most valuable
addition to the home library.</p>

<p>Among the new books by this favorite author, which
Sunday-school Superintendents and all readers of her previous
books will wish to order, are:—</p>

<p><b>One Commonplace Day.</b> Pansy has brought out in
this book a vivid, lifelike story, full of strong incentives to
right thinking and living. 12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p><b>Interrupted.</b> Has all the charm of this author’s style,
grown riper each year. 12mo, extra cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p><b>In the Woods and Out.</b> Admirably suited to the
needs of a large class of young folks. It is composed of the
choicest of short tales so delightful at the twilight hour when
the children clamor for “a story.” 12mo, cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p><b>The Browning Boys.</b> A fascinating story of the growth
of two boys who set out on their birthday to be helpful at
home. By applying the “golden texts” of the International
Sunday-school lessons in their every-day life, they, without
swerving from the strictest sense of right, are able to send
their invalid father to Florida, and were the means of his
restoration to health. 16mo, cloth, 60 cents.</p>

<p><b>A Hedge Fence.</b> A story that will be particularly
pleasing to boys, most of whom will find in its hero a fair
representation of themselves. 16mo, 60 cents.</p>

<p><b>An Endless Chain.</b> From the introduction, on the first
page, of the new superintendent of the Packard Place Sabbath-school,
to the end, there is no flagging of interest in this
bright, fresh, wholesome story. Illustrated. 12mo., $1.50.</p>

<p><b>Side by Side.</b> Short illustrated stories from Bible texts
for the help of boys and girls in their every-day duties.
16mo., cloth, 60 cents.</p>

<p><b>Christie’s Christmas.</b> No more charming little heroine
can be found than the Christie of this volume, and the story
of her journey to spend Christmas, with the great variety of
characters introduced, all of them original and individual in
their way, is perfectly novel and interesting.</p>

<p>As a guide to teachers, rich in suggestions and directions
for methods of teaching, etc., there is nothing better than
<b>Pansy’s Scrap Book</b>. 12mo., cloth, illustrated, $1.00.</p>

<p>In fact all of Pansy’s books have some special charm or
attraction which makes them a power for good wherever
read.</p>

<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>,—Because we know that to you
it is, and should be, largely entrusted to advise our young
people in regard to their reading, because you are powerful
guardians of “literature for the young,” we invite you to
examine the periodicals we publish monthly for children and
young folks: <b>Wide Awake</b>, <b>The Pansy</b>, <b>Our Little
Men and Women</b>, and <b>Babyland</b>. We will supply you
with specimens of these, if you will call, or if you will write
us. These magazines are in the watchful and trained care
of their original editors, and the same purity, strength, and
sparkle characterize each number from month to month,
from year to year. The highest order of fiction, the most
inspiring, lifting, and refining poetry, the most instructive
lessons in history and natural science, the most entertaining
records of travel and adventure, the finest literary and biographical
articles, appear in their pages. <i>The Congregationalist</i>
said last week of <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>, that it “sets its
readers to thinking for themselves along many different lines.
It has solved the problem how to proportion fun and soberness
best in such a publication better than any of its rivals.”
<i>Literary Life</i>, after saying that “<span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> is the best
monthly magazine for young folks published in the country,”
goes on to say of it, “Next to watching Nature herself, it is
the finest educational work we ever have seen for children.
A child made happy by such a work will possess an intelligence
and richness of mind beyond the mere range of school
lessons.” We do indeed confidently trust that should you
direct your classes to our magazines, you will find them a
good means of preparation of hearts and minds for your own
important work. You will find the magazines graded suitably
for the use of infant classes, and upwards.</p>

</p>

<p>Among publishers who have carried into their work serious
convictions as to their duty to the public in the matter of
supplying good literature, and who have resolutely resisted
all temptations in the more lucrative direction of that which
is simply sensational, an honorable place may be claimed
for D. Lothrop &amp; Co., who have accomplished in the United
States a work second to that of no publishing-house.</p>

<p>This work was undertaken by D. Lothrop &amp; Co. years
ago. With the firm conviction that ultimate success would
attend their efforts, they have employed the pens of scores
of those who have shared their convictions, including some
of the best-known authors at home and abroad, and have
sent out an ever-increasing stream of pure, attractive, and
instructive literature, which has reached every part of the
land, and made their name famous everywhere.</p>

<p>In a general way the public are familiar with the aims of
this house, and have come to regard its imprint upon a book
as a guaranty of excellence in all essential qualities.</p>

</p>

<p>The Choicest Works of Popular Authors, issued monthly.</p>

<p>The works issued in this library are uniformly of a high standard and may well come under that class
of literature styled “home fiction,” a literature, that, while free from the flashy, sensational effect of much
of the fiction of to-day, is, nevertheless, brilliant in style, fresh and strong in action, and of absorbing interest.
It is a class that all the young folks, as well as the fathers and mothers and older brothers and sisters,
may read with profit as well as great pleasure.</p>

<p><b>1. THE PETTIBONE NAME, by Margaret Sidney</b>, author of <i>The Five Little Peppers</i>, etc.
It is a delightful story of New England life and manners, sparkling in style, bright and effective in incident,
and of intense interest. There has been no recent figure in American fiction more clearly or skilfully drawn
than Miss Judith Pettibone. Most of the characters of the book are such as may be met with in any New
England village.</p>

<p><b>2. MY GIRLS, by Lida A. Churchill.</b> A story of four ambitious girls. Their struggles to
realize their ambitions and their trials and successes, make a story of intense interest.</p>

<p><b>3. WITHIN THE SHADOW, by Dorothy Holroyd.</b> “The most successful book of the
year.” “The plot is ingenious, yet not improbable, the character drawing strong and vigorous, the story
throughout one of brilliancy and power.” “The book cannot help making a sensation.”—<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p><b>4. FAR FROM HOME.</b> From the German of Johannes Van Derval. Translated by <b>Kathrine
Hamilton</b>. A fascinating story of life and travel in foreign lands.</p>

<p><b>5. GRANDMOTHER NORMANDY, by the author of Silent Tom.</b> The story is fascinatingly
told. The character of Grandmother Normandy, stern, relentless and unforgiving, almost to the
last, is strongly drawn, and the author has shown much skill in the construction of the story.</p>

<p><b>6. AROUND THE RANCH, by Belle Kellogg Towne.</b> It is original, fresh, and written
with great naturalness and power; its pathos is exquisitely touching. The opening scenes are laid in the
Colorado mining regions.</p>

<p><b>7. A FORTUNATE FAILURE, by Caroline B. LeRow.</b> The author of this charming
book is widely known as a successful writer of magazine stories. In this story, the principal character is
the sweet, bright and ambitious daughter of a New Hampshire farmer, who has been placed at boarding-school
by a rich aunt, where her development is traced under the surrounding influences.</p>

<p><b>8. BUT HALF A HEART, by Marie Oliver.</b> The author has won an enviable reputation
as a writer of the higher and purer class of fiction. This is the story of a girl’s life, and is intense in interest,
elevated in tone.</p>

<p><b>9. MORE WAYS THAN ONE, by Alice Perry</b>, author of “Esther Pennefather.” A story
of singular beauty and power.</p>

<p><b>10. VIOLET DOUGLAS; or, the Problems of Life, by Emma Marshall.</b> It pictures
the beauty and nobleness of a life of active and unselfish devotion to the welfare of others.</p>

<p><b>11. THE TALBURY GIRLS.</b> A very sweet story, with great fulness of incident and insight
into different spheres of life.</p>

<p><b>12. A WHITE HAND, by Ella Farman.</b> A story of American society, by the editor of
<span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>Young people are born naturalists. Their first inquiries
are in regard to the attractive objects of nature
around them; and their future mental activity—or
stupidity—depends largely upon the answers they
receive. <i>Parents</i> and <i>teachers</i> should, therefore, be
able to encourage and satisfy the first cravings of their
inquiring minds. To aid in this, and to afford abundant
entertainment more pleasing than toys, far
cheaper and more instructive than mere amusement,
we have secured a large quantity of the Rocky Mountain
Cabinets expressly for our special premium use.
Each Juvenile Cabinet contains 4 specimens of gold,
3 of silver, 1 zinc, 1 lead, 3 iron, 2 copper ores—each
a different variety—1 agate (surface polished), opalized
wood, rock crystal, silicified wood, molydenum,
Iceland spar, topaz, 2 jaspers, dendrite, tourmaline,
opal agate, arragonite, milky quartz, sulphur, selenite,
Amazon stone, feldspar, fluorspar, variscite, chalcedony,
petrified wood, alabaster, mica, wavellite, etc.
The specimens in this cabinet are in a strong pasteboard
box, divided into 40 sections. A descriptive
manual is sent with each cabinet. Price 85 cents
postpaid.</p>
<p>Address all orders to D. Lothrop &amp; Co., Boston.</p>

<p class='center'><b>READ WHAT THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE SAYS ABOUT GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.</b></p>

<p>One of the most admirable family journals ever published is that which is brought out in Holyoke, Mass.
and New York under the title of <span class="smcap">Good Housekeeping</span>, by Clark W. Bryan &amp; Co. It is a practical and interesting
instructor in all pleasant, refined and healthful modes of living. It is full of good sense, and its
lessons, whether in manners, morals, food, needlework and household management, are generally the best
of their kind. The number of May 15 opens <span class="smcap">Good Housekeeping’s</span> second year—a year which it is to be
hoped will add to its already established prosperity.—<i>New York Daily Tribune, May 11th, 1886.</i></p>

<p class='center'><b>READ WHAT THE GOSPEL BANNER (Augusta, Me.) SAYS ABOUT GOOD HOUSEKEEPING.</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good Housekeeping</span> is a fortnightly magazine conducted in the interest of every department of household
management. It has rapidly advanced in public favor in its first year, which is due to the excellent
articles from its special contributors and the superior mechanical work represented in its successive numbers.
All the details of housekeeping from cellar to attic, kitchen to parlor, cookery to adornments, are attended
to in the course of the yearly issues, while good contributions on purely literary topics are not lacking.
Holyoke, Mass., and N. Y.: Clark W. Bryan &amp; Co. $2.50 a year; $1.50 for six months; $1.00 for four
months; 10 cents single copy.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>During the first year of its publication <span class="smcap">Good Housekeeping</span> has won for itself an enviable reputation
in the Homes of the World. Its pages have been industriously and faithfully devoted to the improvement
and development of the nobler and more desirable features of Home Life.</p>

<p>It is original in design, comprehensive in management and strong in individuality of character and conduct.
Its discussions have been practical and had with a view of being elevating, instructive and useful in
the highest degree to every one having an ambition or desire to make the Home attractive and those who
dwell there to feel that “there’s no place like home.”</p>

<p>It has won the commendations of the press, not only in its own country, but in many others where the
English language is spoken, such as has never been accorded to a family publication of such tender years.</p>

<p>It numbers among its list of contributors many of the ablest and most noted writers of the day, on
family topics, and these are supplemented by contributions from the pens of many practical and successful
housekeepers measurably unknown to fame but none the less valuable workers in the field of Home
Literature.</p>

<p>Among these may be mentioned Catherine Owen, Rose Terry Cooke, Marion Harland, Maria Parloa,
Hester M. Poole, Christine Terhune Herrick, H. Annette Poole, Margaret Sidney, Mrs. D. H. R. Goodale,

<p>To preserve the richness of color or delicacy of tint of your summer
dresses, make suds of hot water and <span class="smcap">Ivory Soap</span>, allow to
cool until lukewarm, then wash your dresses in the solution. Ordinary
soaps contain too much alkali, which in a short time bleaches
the color and destroys its beauty. Prof. Silliman, of Yale College,
“The <span class="smcap">Ivory Soap</span> can not injure the most delicate fabric.”</p>


<p class='center'>A WORD OF WARNING.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>There are many white soaps, each represented to be “just as good as the
‘Ivory’;” they ARE NOT, but like all counterfeits, lack the peculiar and remarkable
qualities of the genuine. Ask for “Ivory” Soap and insist upon getting it.</b></p></blockquote>
